✖ Lyrics:

Could you just turn on my signal, push it full throttle
Feel the vibrations (accelerate)
Just take a ride downtown, drive it fast, big sound
To the right station (accelerate)

All the boys tell me
I'm so delectably irresistible
If you play your cards right, I'll let you in tonight
Put me on your pedestal

I am like a race
Can you finish me
Oh, you know
This show ain't over
Just pick up the key
And unlock me
Oh, you know
This show ain't over

Get me to dance
Beg me to stay
Rev my engine
Accelerate
Could you just turn on my signal, push it full throttle
Feel the vibrations (Accelerate)
Just take a ride downtown, drive it fast, big sound
To the right station (Accelerate)

Push it up on me, move your machinery
Break this road in two
Turn on my headlights, drive all through the night
Come exhaust my fumes

It's an endless chase
Are you in the game
Oh, you know
This show ain't over
Just pick up the key
And unlock me
Oh, you know
This show ain't over

Get me to dance
Beg me to stay
Rev my engine
Accelerate
Could you just turn on my signal, push it full throttle
Feel the vibrations (accelerate)
Just take a ride downtown, drive it fast, big sound
To the right station (accelerate)

It's so insane, the smoke is all, all around
You drive me crazy
My brake is up, push it down
Don't stop until I make, make a sound
You're first place, I'm giving you, you the crown

Get me to dance
Beg me to stay
Rev my engine
Accelerate (you're first place, I'm giving you the crown)

Get me to dance
Beg me to stay
Rev my engine
Accelerate
Could you just turn on my signal, push it full throttle
Feel the vibrations (accelerate)
Just take a ride downtown, drive it fast, big sound
To the right station (accelerate)
