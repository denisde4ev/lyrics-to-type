Spellbound by the anacrusis of your song
The moment when the weak prey on the strong
This clandestine symphony intoxicates
Defenseless I remain before the first light breaks

I give in to the rhythm of passion
Like a wolf calling out to the moon
Synchronized in this amorous motion
Incandescently we bloom
Uncontrollable burning desire
Overwhelms until dawn do us part
Bella donna, you possess my restless heart

Dreamlike language, sinful musicality
Tasting the pristine discovery
My eyes touch you where my fingers feel your flow
Where the instruments of lust and love play their role

I give in to the rhythm of passion
Like a wolf calling out to the moon
Synchronized in this amorous motion
Incandescently we bloom
Uncontrollable burning desire
Overwhelms until dawn do us part
Bella donna, you possess my restless heart

I give in to the rhythm of passion
Like a wolf calling out to the moon
Synchronized in this amorous motion
Incandescently we bloom
Uncontrollable burning desire
Overwhelms until dawn do us part
Bella donna, you possess my restless heart
