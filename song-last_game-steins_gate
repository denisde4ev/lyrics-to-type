Come to me
Embrace my tears
Let me guide you down into my soul
And let us party for the world to realize
There is peace, the truth within us

Emptiness erodes your heart
Coz you're free from pain and sorrow
Future is just too bright to show you ways
Wake up now...it's time to lead new souls

Orbit of phonton and universe
I am just the part of its plan
Me ni wa mienai yuganda sora  hito wa doko e to aruite iku no?
The last game

Hold my hand
Melt my heart
Feel like I've been caught up in somewhere cold
Like the moon and stars hideen in the dark
Finally I found myself in your eyes

If we were
Meant to be, my love
Why do we keep making mistakes
Nothing can fulfill us in this world
Give me hopes to believe in our fate

Orbit of photon and universe
I will follow you all the way
Kizukiyou no nai gokan no shihai  ikiru imi sae shirasarenu mama
The last game

Orbit of photon and universe
I ama just the part of its plan
Me ni wa mienai yuganda sora  hito wa doko e to aruite iku no?

Orbit of photon and universe
I will follow you all the way
Kizukiyou no nai gokan no shihai  ikiru imi sae shirasarenu mama
The last game
