She speaks to me in Persian
Tells me that she loves me
The girl with golden eyes
And though I hardly know her
I let her in my veins
And trust her with my life

I wish I had never kissed her
'Cause I just can't resist her
The girl with golden eyes
Every time she whispers
"Take me in your arms
The way you did last night"

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
If I can get away from her
And save my worthless life

I wake up every morning
Jonesing for her love
The girl with golden eyes
I won't have to wait long
'Til she buries me with roses
'Cause she's always by my side

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
If I can get away from her
And save my worthless life

Day one, dope free
I went to the clinic today and got the first dose of methadone
I'm out of dope so I threw away all my rigs
Day two, I can't believe it's been two days without junk
Fucking smack, it just ruins peoples' lives
At first it seems so sweet, then you wake up next to a monster
Day three, I haven't had anything for three days now
This withdrawal is killing me, it's like shock therapy to my guts
Day four, last visit to the clinic
My whole body feels like it's cracking into pieces
"Fragile" doesn't even come close to describing how I feel
Day five, I'm sick as a dog, but this handful of painkillers
And a lotta whiskey's gonna get me through
Day six, when I'm left to my own devices, I go fucking insane
I'll never use heroin again
Day seven, I can't believe I'm clean!
Day eight, everyone says I look better
Day nine, the parasites are panicking
Day ten, they seem amazed that I'm alive!

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
If I can get away from her
And save my worthless life

Everything will be okay
Everything will be alright
If I can get away from her
And save my worthless life
