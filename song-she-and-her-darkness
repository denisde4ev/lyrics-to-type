############################################################
My heart weights minimum a tone
An army's feet pounding on my head
Maybe I'll wake up one day to notice
That all my life was just a dream

And maybe I'll be better off without you
You left me here with all my thoughts
I'd write a zillion words or walk a million miles
I'd sleep on broken glass just not to lose your smiles

I travel for you around the world
Collecting moments, oh how absurd
To bring you beauty, to bring you joy
I wish I'd be a little boy

Where is that silence you primised me?
Why is that distance so close to me?
Why is your violence still hurting me?
Why are your eyes avoiding me?

Let me say thank you for all that you have given me
Thank you for everything you've done
Forgive me for saying one last thing
I miss you and I hope you hear this song

I travel for you around the world
Collecting moments, o how absurd
To bring you beauty, to bring you joy
I wish I'd be a little boy

I'm dying for you, can't you see?
I'm lying for you to be free
I hunger for you, 'cause I can't eat
I'd vanish for you in defeat
