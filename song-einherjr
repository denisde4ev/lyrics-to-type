Ei, Ei, Ei, Ei, Ei, Einherjr x2

A loaded clean assault carabine
The one way ticket to the afterlife
When the .308 decides my fate
The closure of the warrior’s strife

Never backing down, I’m standing till the final round
For the honour I defend
Take the raven flag and burn it as my body bag
When my life comes to its end
When my time has come, I vow and swear
I will go to Valhalla in combat gear
I’ll take my place in Odin’s hall
Let me fly to Asgaard when I fall

Ei, Ei, Ei, Ei, Ei, Einherjr x2

Some are not prepared, some are living scared
Condemning those who conquer fear
But the price of free society
Is paid by Odin’s blood wet spear

Where the brass meets bone, where all men are on their own
Only seconds from facing their maker
Where the wargod reigns in the hellfire and the pain
Granting work to the undertaker

When my time has come, I vow and swear
I will go to Valhalla in combat gear
I’ll take my place in Odin’s hall
Let me fly to Asgard when I fall

When my time has come, I vow and swear
I will go to Valhalla in combat gear
I’ll take my place in Odin’s hall
Let me fly to Asgard when I fall

Under raven banner and the burning sky
Where the bullets and the Valkyries fly
Let me hear the raven’s cry
Odin take me when I die
