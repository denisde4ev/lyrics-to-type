I remember the day like it was yesterday
I got my eyes on you
like a dream come true
Now I hold you in my arms, it feels so marvelous
How endlessly you are filling me

With all my heart, with all my soul
I'll be there for you forever
Never let you go, never let you go
When it's dark, when it's bright
I'll be there for you forever
Never let you go, never let you go

When I'm feeling the pain
while a thousand miles separate us
Are you still here with me in all my dreams?
It feels so perfect, so perfect to come back home
You're still all I see and you're all I need

With all my heart, with all my soul
I'll be there for you forever
Never let you go, never let you go
When it's dark, when it's bright
I'll be there for you forever
Never let you go, never let you go

I'll be there for you forever
Never let you go, never let you go
When it's dark, when it's bright
I'll be there for you forever
Never let you go, never let you go
