The birds are flying low
The same old song is going on, and on

Way too many times
I've seen this same old twisted pantomime

They say the darkest hours are just before the dawn
That we must die to be reborn
I'm still alive, I'm ready for the pain
If I fall, I'll rise again

I spread my wings and like the midnight sun
I will be rising
Into the frozen heights, where stars are born
And where they die
I'm lighting up horizons
With thunder and lightning
Through the darkest skies
Where even angels fear to fly

Where angels fear to fly

It felt like the end
They hit the ceiling and they fell, and fell

The wind already blew
And the rays of light were shining through

They say the darkest hours are just before the dawn
That we must die to be reborn
I'm still alive, I'm ready for the pain
When I fall, I'll rise again

Through the glass ceiling
We will fly
The truth comes screaming
Loud and high
(Echoes of old lies will die)
This is where my dreams begin
I feel the power from within

I spread my wings and like the midnight sun
I will be rising
Into the frozen heights, where stars are born
And where they die
I'm lighting up horizons
With thunder and lightning
Through the darkest skies
Where even angels fear to fly

Where angels fear to fly
Where angels fear to fly
