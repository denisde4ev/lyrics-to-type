Tuh-yeah, ayy
You're in the DOGHOUSE now
Yeah, sounds good

I'm fresh to death, always dressed for sex
But my life's a mess, I just try my best
At least my dick's erect, put in cardiac
But they won't arrest, bitch fuck your ex

I'm the Devil in the flesh, don't recommend sendin' threats
I tell my set, only aim for the neck
And that's how we send a message to the rest
Keep a blade by my side, you don't want me upset

I'm not innocent, I'ma sin again
If you can find better man, go and send 'em in
Lost her number, ask your bitch if I can hit again
She brought a friend, I'll hit both 'cause I'm a gentleman

She say I'm handsome, baby, hand me some ass then
They can speak on my name, just never up in a past tense
If they don't listen, I'ma go and get my mask then
They only pissed 'cause I went and surpassed them

Freak type, want a bite from this python
Read between the lines, you can make it to the pylons
She don't know me, but know I'm somethin' to keep her eyes on
I'm not a sex symbol, I'm a sex icon

If you don't trust, I'm the one to rely on
If they cross you, they cross me and my guys, huh
They say let bygones be bygones
I say fuck 'em all, bitch, I'm gone

I'm fresh to death, always dressed for sex
But my life's a mess, I just try my best
At least my dick's erect, put in cardiac
But they won't arrest, bitch fuck your ex

I'm the Devil in the flesh, don't recommend sendin' threats
I tell my set, only aim for the neck
And that's how we send a message to the rest
Keep a blade by my side, you don't want me upset

They can't stomach me, yeah, I'm hard to digest
Quit tryin' me, maybe then they'll die less
If I see a frog leap, might start to dissect
I got a felony, ain't afraid of bloodshed

They ain't die yet, we can expedite the process
Stick to the story, but they out doin' side quests
Doctor said I'm too fly, might need to fly less
They want action, smoke 'em like a fuckin', uh

I'm fresh to death, always dressed for sex
But my life's a mess, I just try my best
At least my dick's erect, put in cardiac
But they won't arrest, bitch fuck your ex

I'm the Devil in the flesh, don't recommend sendin' threats
I tell my set, only aim for the neck
And that's how we send a message to the rest
Keep a blade by my side, you don't want me upset

Yeah-yeah
