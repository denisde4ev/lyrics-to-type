Rest your head, may your dreams be blessed
Don't you fear, your angel's always near
By your side. Humming tones soft and low

Close your eyes. Let the cradle swing
Forward and back. Let the silence sing
Silvery beams, bright white clouds. Sweet, sweet dreams

Mercy
Have mercy on my soul
Mercy

Mercy
Have mercy on my soul
Mercy
Please god help me

Sun is gone nothing shines upon
No dusk no dawn, thereâ€™s no Neverland
Your shadows grow, and you know the bedbugs do bite

You tremble and shake. You shake your dreamlands tree
Lost and gone. No dreams are left for thee
The demon in you head
The traveler in the dark kills your final spark
Mercy
Have mercy on my soul
Mercy

Mercy
Have mercy on my soul
Mercy
Please god help me
