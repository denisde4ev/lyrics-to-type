So here we stand
Our backs against the wall
Opened eyes
We are here, we are here

Come with me
It is not far anymore
Hear my voice
Let it ring, let it ring

I'll sing you home
I'll show the way
Into the light of darkest day
Into the night
Without a fight
I'll sing you home, I'll sing you home

I'll sing you home
I'll show the way
Into the light of darkest day
Into the night
Without a fight
I'll sing you home

I'll sing you home
I'll show the way
Into the light of darkest day
Into the night
Without a fight
I'll sing you home, I'll sing you home
