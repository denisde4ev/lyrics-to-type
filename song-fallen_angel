Hi Depression
How yea been?
It's been a long time, we meet again

I've been good
The fuck you been up to though?
Lately you look like your unstoppable
You must just not of check your messages
I've been trying to get to you desperately
It's time you came and pay your debt to me

I just want to be left in peace
Why the fuck you gotta mess with me?
So sick and tired of you testing me
Don't get to smile. Don't get to sleep

Sounds like you just need stress relief
Cut yourself or maybe take some pills
Cause nobody cares if you die or live
A waste of space, another useless soul
The world is better... if you just go

Why you an asshole?
Making it easy?
As long as I'm breathing, my family needs me!

Give it a week and they'll forget your gone
Forget your name, forget your songs
You think you're loved but that's a lie
I cross my heart and I hope you die
You can't cope with this
You can't cope with change
You got knots to tie
You got ropes to hang

But what do I do when I can't get a job
And I can't get the fuck out my house?
I'm loosing it slowly my life is unfolding
And this isn't what I'm about!

Whoa
Tone it down. You're going to bust a vein
It's just your fate this isn't just a phase
I'm drawn to you and you belong to me
I hope you see now that you're stuck with me

The voice inside your head I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will make you...
Just another fallen angel

Get the fuck out of my head!

Heha! Hey! Hold up man
I'm not done with you!
I'm going to do what I'm going to do!

Fuck this shit I'm not comfortable!
All I ever do is run from you!
I can't except this, I crave acceptance
I stay expecting the same exact thing
The same rejection, The same deflection
The same infection, My brain's defective!

Don't you want to come and play with me?
We can see the world, at least a darker side of it?
I got in and left a mark inside your head
I'm not leaving until the heart comes out of your chest
Heh, I've seen your soul it isn't worth you keeping it
And your incompleteness is what's been completing me

The voice inside your head - I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will make you...
Just another fallen angel

Get the fuck out of my head!

I see dark on the brightest day
I fight the pain, I just want to gain some confidence
Locked in the mother-fucking box on top is a rock
I don't know how I got in this
(I do) Fuck you, fuck everyone else and the whole world!
I've been on the edge and I'm unsure
I have been feeling like something is building inside of me
Killing me slowly, I feel like I'm dying and I've been trying to deal with the stress
Life is a mess! I wish I was blessed! I wish I was...

Dead

Maybe you're right

You know that I'm right

I'm sick of my life

You're sick of your life?
Well come with me now
We could end it tonight
We could end it tonight

The voice inside your head I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will take you
You could be my fallen angel
