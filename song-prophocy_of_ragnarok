Prophecy of Ragnarok, twilight of the Gods
No escaping destiny when Balder's gone
Snow and ice will freeze the worlds, mountains crack
Fenrir's fetters is no more, the sky is turning black

Prophecy of Ragnarok, legend of our death
Time to be corroded by the serpent's breath
Riding through the wastelands, there is fire everywhere
The gods won't be around to hear our final prayer

Axe-time, sword-time - gods go under
Wind-time, wolf-time - death to all
Axe-time, sword-time - shields are sundered
Wind-time, wolf-time - worlds will fall

Titans of justice - fearless we stand
Odin All-Father are we blessed by your hand?
Together we rise, together we fight
We ride into battle and into the night

The giants are raging, the gods meet their fate
The heavens crack open, thunder fall through the land
Guardian of Bifrost is blowing his horn
We ride into battle and into the storm

Brothers they be fighting together side by side
Valkyries assembling as Aegir brings the tide
In Odin's Hall we gather champions from the past
Warriors of Valhalla - we will die at last!

Everything's devoured by the rushing of waves
The bottom of the ocean will be our graves
Mountains clash together, under Yggdrasil
Crumbling to pieces and sink into the sea

Axe-time, sword-time - gods go under
Wind-time, wolf-time - death to all
Axe-time, sword-time - shields are sundered
Wind-time, wolf-time - worlds will fall

Titans of justice - fearless we stand
Odin All-Father are we blessed by your hand?
Together we rise, together we fight
We ride into battle and into the night

The giants are raging, the gods meet their fate
The heavens crack open, thunder fall through the land
Guardian of Bifrost is blowing his horn
We ride into battle and into the storm

A perfect darkness follows all
A perfect silence to end the war
Oh Ginnungagap, oh bottomless abyss
It's the ultimate nothingness where death is bliss

(Axe time, sword time)
Warriors of Valhalla
(Wind time, wolf time)
Hear my final words
(Axe time, sword time)
This is our purpose
(Wind time, wolf time)
This is our end
(Axe time, sword time)
(Wind time, wolf time)
(Axe time, sword time)
(Wind time, wolf time)
Worlds will fall!
