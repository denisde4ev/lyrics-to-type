As I look back at the things I've done
And see the person that I've become
I realize I have to pay the dues for setting loose this sea of flames
As I review the path I chose, all the damage caused
Judgment day for me has come, I ask myself was it right, was I wrong?

This is the night all angels cry and their tears set heaven alight
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding and no one but myself to blame
This is the night all angels cry as they're falling with wings on fire
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding, I'm the one who has to pay

Now that I'm done reflecting on my past for me there'll be no "peace at last"
Cause I can't wash my hands of all the bloodshed, all the pain I caused
And as the sands of time run low
Can't find my way home
Judgment day for me has come, I ask myself was it right, was I wrong?

This is the night all angels cry and their tears set heaven alight
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding and no one but myself to blame
This is the night all angels cry as they're falling with wings on fire
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding, I'm the one who has to pay

The time has come for you to go now
Everybody's got to pay somehow
Step up and take your final bow now
Make sure to close the door on your way out
This is the night all angels cry and their tears set heaven alight
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding and no one but myself to blame
This is the night all angels cry as they're falling with wings on fire
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding, I'm the one who has to pay
