Loki, the greatest magician of all
He's on a mission, a giant to stall
He seduces, disguised as a mare
And carries out Sleipnir, his womb he would tear

He's quicker than quicksand and faster than all
He still has no stable, he lives in a hall
Over the mountains and over the seas
Swifter then time, he moves like a breeze

Faster than lightning he rides
Over the mountain so high
Swiftly he flies over land over sea
All-Father's pony takes the lead
For he is the ultimate breed
And Sleipnir is his name

He carries All-Father from his mighty hall
From battle to battle, he's stronger than all
Like the wind he rides to the north
Eight legs of fire venturing forth

A slippery charger, no one is his match
A god among horses - he strikes and attack
Hooves made of steel, like war drums so loud
Run Sleipnir, run, show us the meaning of haste

Faster than lightning he rides
Over the mountain so high
Swiftly he flies over land over sea
All-Father's pony takes the lead
For he is the ultimate breed
And Sleipnir is his name

Faster than lightning he rides
Over the mountain so high
Swiftly he flies over land over sea
All-Father's pony takes the lead
For he is the ultimate breed
And Sleipnir is his name...
