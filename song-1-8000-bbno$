Still on that—
(One, eight, zero, zero, he's so handsome, he's my hero)
(One, eight, zero, zero)

Still on that 1-800, hit me up for a good time
My shit bumps 'til it push me outta line
You can't spell my name without the dollar sign
Rainbow money, take whatever, yes, I'm colorblind

Eight wheels in the front, they some big toys
2025, it's the year of the it boy
Got a little money, yeah, got a little Bitcoin
She, she, she, she makin' me real coy
Never stoop too low, I don't sip Dunkin'
Quite nice top, I ain't talkin' no muffin
On a first date, stay trauma dumpin'
Blah, blah, blah, like somethin', somethin'
One pump, two pump, three pump
The way she workin' that shit, she left me comatose (Uh)
Three plus six is nine, this baby ain't talkin' 'bout tic-tac-toe
Uh, she a little freak, I guess I'm an animal, E-I-E-I-O
Two steppin' like Cotton Eye Joe (Uh, bbno$)

Don't fuck this shit up for me
Don't fuck this shit up for me

Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick

Yeah, dick real deadly, do a lil' damage
Got, like, twenty children, Nick Cannon
Fuck, I'm sexy, snap like sandwich
Hit a double threesome, ride a tandem
Got good DNA, shawty thick, got TNA
I'm makin' moves, no POA
Ain't bustin' quick, no ETA
It's either she or maybe her, I cannot pick, pick, pick, pick, pick
I got that Rolie Polie Olie, it go tick, tick, tick, tick, tick
I'm at the Nino playin' blackjack, always hit, hit, hit, hit, hit
If baby's broke, he's only doin' it for the bit, bit, bit, bit, bit

Don't fuck this shit up for me
Don't fuck this shit up for me
Don't fuck this shit up for me
Please, please, please, please
