Rising up from a day of plunder
The ale of yesterday
Has gone down under
The battlefield awaits my soul
To Odin - For whom I wait
Thor guide me through my battles
Lead me home to Asgard
The victorious will rise
To the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

In the hour of final judgment
All Father, lead my way
When the fire of war reign
I will watch my brothers fall
Our names will be long forgotten
We live on forever
The victorious will rise
To the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil

In the dust I swore my hatred
From seeing unborn children die
The mother's weeping wakes my sword
For vengeance
I thirst for blood

I ride into infinity
And as I fall I rise in Asgard
The victorious will rise
To the glory of the gods

Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
For the blood is running still
From the roots of Yggdrasil
Rise above the mountains
Light a fire in the sky
Carry me to the hill
To the top of Yggdrasil
