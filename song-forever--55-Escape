WEAK!
I am crawling on my knees
I am tired of begging please
I am falling down the stairs
-wake up you're weak!

In my head I went erased
But my life has gone to waste
I am falling on my face
-you're weak, you're weak!

Watch me turn this around
Take the pain from my life
Walk the distance from fear
Forever

Watch me turn this around
Take the pain from my life
Walk the distance from fear

Forever!

WEAK!
I am crawling on my knees
-wake up you're weak!
I am falling on my face
-you're weak, you're weak!
I am crawling on my knees
