I sit alone in my room nobody knows what I do
I'm just so broken and bruised my friends notice it to
If they could feel what I feel or take a stroll in my shoes
Then they would understand but they just don't have a clue
These dudes call me goof loser and make me mockery
Cause I don't have a body like the guys on the soccer team
When walkin' the halls I feel like everyone's watchin' me
It bothers me so much resulting in loss of sleep
I feel ugly that's why my wrist
Has cut scars on every single bit of it
I feel worthless so I wanna hurt this
Joke of a body they say belongs in a circus
It's not for attention it's more of an addiction
I wish there was a medicine to rid me of this sickness
I've been searchin' my purpose for a long time
But something's tellin' me now that I'll be alright

When you hurt hurt yourself on the outside
Does it make you feel better on the inside?
You said yes but you know that that's a damn lie
It turns a tumbling rock into a land slide
When you hurt hurt yourself on the outside
Does it make you feel better on the inside?
You said yes but you know that that's a damn lie
It turns a tumbling rock into a land slide

I wear long sleeve shirts in the summer time
Cause I don't want anybody seein' my cut lines
Even though I haven't done it in some time
Every day a little more I'm learnin' to love my
Self for me and block words they call me
There are thousands like me I'm part of an army
If you take a look around its rather alarming
How many people are actually self-harming
Don't you get it its deeper than sayin' don't do it
Some days I wanna fade away it's like I'm not human
This is goin' out to everybody going through it
I'll take your pain away and make it fade into the music
Make art trade the blade for a pen
I can see in your heart that you're a ten outa ten
In all honesty promise me that never again
Will you sever your skin you're so much better than this

When you hurt hurt yourself on the outside
Does it make you feel better on the inside?
You said yes but you know that that's a damn lie
It turns a tumbling rock into a land slide
When you hurt hurt yourself on the outside
Does it make you feel better on the inside?
You said yes but you know that that's a damn lie
It turns a tumbling rock into a land slide

It's been couple months now since I stopped cuttin'
It's been so long it feels like I've never done it
Though I still have these scars that remind me of it
My fam's proud I found a way to rise above it
A combination of things made me wake up and think
Take a look in the mirror and through my blade in the sink
I tried out for the team might even make it this week
I've got an appetite plus I'm gettin' plenty of sleep
So what changed? Everybody's dying to know
I was dyin' slow now I keep my eyes on the road
I guess I just got sick of compromisin' my soul
Now I want everyone else to realize that there's hope
So if you're stuck in rut then I'm pulling you out
I'll help lace up your gloves so you can knock out doubt
And punch out pain start takin' control of your life
The dark doesn't stand a chance when you're holdin' a light

When you hurt hurt yourself on the outside
Does it make you feel better on the inside?
You said yes but you know that that's a damn lie
It turns a tumbling rock into a land slide
When you hurt hurt yourself on the outside
Does it make you feel better on the inside?
You said yes but you know that that's a damn lie
It turns a tumbling rock into a land slide
