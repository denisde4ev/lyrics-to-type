I was blinded by the darkness
Wishing for a ray of light
And every day I felt so heartless
With the future not insight

You crossed my path when I was down
You brought me back on solid ground
You gave me strength you changed my luck
My only friend when times were though

Little drops of heaven
My saving grace, sweet embrace
Twentyfour/seven
Let your love rain and ease the pain
Drops of heaven

I was in my darkest hour
When I felt an angels kiss
And all the heartache were devoured
In a thunderstorm of gliss

You picked me up you broke the ice
Gave me a touch of paradise
Standing tall, I'm shining through
And girl its all because of you

Little drops of heaven
My saving grace, sweet embrace
Twentyfour/seven
Let your love rain and ease the pain
Drops of heaven
My inspiration, love creation
Twentyfour/seven
My heart and soul, internal glow
Drops of heaven
Oh, yeah

Little drops of heaven
My saving grace, sweet embrace
Twentyfour/seven
Let your love rain and ease the pain
Drops of heaven
My inspiration, love creation
Twentyfour/seven
My heart and soul, internal glow
Drops of heaven
-Drops of heaven, drops of heaven
-Little drops of heaven, drops of heaven (x4)

I was blinded by the darkness
Wishing for a ray of light
And every day I felt so heartless
