Behind the stars, behind the moon
I need the time to be alone
To find a place that's far from you
Now I know what I must do

Can somebody tell, is this heaven or hell?
We felt sense of tears pouring down
And so long, farewell, is this heaven or hell?
I'm here but I still don't know why

I have a heart, I have a soul
But I behaved just like a fool
You breathe the air, you're everywhere
This is goodbye and I don't care

To find a place that's far from you
Now I know what I must do

Can somebody tell, is this heaven or hell?
We felt sense of tears pouring down
I find and I am, is this heaven or hell?
Please help me, I don't wanna die

Into darkness, where I'm forced to stay
And to motion, try my best to find a way
To balance my life from the edge of the danger again

Can somebody tell, is this heaven or hell?
We felt sense of tears pouring down
And so long, farewell, is this heaven or hell?
Please help me, I don't wanna die

Can somebody tell, is this heaven or hell?
We felt sense of tears pouring down
I find and I am, is this heaven or hell?
Iâ€™m here but I still don't know why
