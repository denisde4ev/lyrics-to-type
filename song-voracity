I am very very crazy
Very sure no one could ever stop me
This web is craving the world
And it consumes it wanting more

One, two, three, four

Welcome to our dinner party in the moonlight
Everyone's here so let's enjoy the feast
I can't stop, can't stop eating
Can't stop, can't stop, not enough

Anything can be eaten
Even if you say no
Ahahahah

Are you ready for the full course freshly
Picked for the flavor's sadistic pleasure
Don't stop, don't stop feeding
Don't stop, don't stop, one more bite

I want more, I need more
It's sin I hunger for

I am very very crazy
Very sure no one could ever stop me
Now that you've had your fill
Let's kill our karma
I wanna go
Very very tasty
Very satisfying
Let's have a toast
This web is craving the world
And it consumes it wanting more

I just want to eat
How tasty it is

One, two, three, four

Everything
Let's throw it on the chopping board
Let's strike down our sanity
And prey upon it
Can't stop, can't stop eating
Can't stop, can't stop, lost myself

I can't, can't erase this disgrace
But this crime is no mistake

You are very very like a berry
Ripe and red and ready to eat
Tell me what tastes the best
The juicy, fresh there's no contest
Very very we are berries
Foolish people gushing with life
Without a trace, they vanish
And they are never seen again

I just want to eat
How tasty it is

Go ahead - call it sin
That's what it is
Call it what you want
No shame in it
Instinct, oh so devilish
And your appetite is the catalyst
Ahahah

I am very very crazy
Very sure no one could ever stop me
Now that you've had your fill
Let's kill our karma
I wanna go
Very very tasty
Very satisfying
Let's have a toast
This web is craving the world
And it consumes it wanting more

I am very very hungry
Very very very tasty very...

I am very very hungry
Very very very tasty very...

I am very very hungry
Very very very tasty very...

I am very very hungry
Very very very tasty very...
