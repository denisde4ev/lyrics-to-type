Here sitting in my chair
With memories and tears
Thinking about life
About being a man
And doing what's right
Finding my path in life

And now as days turn to dust
My heart's seen enough
And I will now go on
My story's been read
The stage now is closed
My soul now lives on

I am done for
I have won
I've done my part right
I'm number one
No matter what they thrown at me, I won
I am home
I'm number one

Hearts been broken, crushed and steeled
By my own mistakes
I have done wrong
Ladies been swooned
Bridges been burned
My words have hurt

Doors been opened and been closed
I've been pushed, dragged and schooled
But it made me strong
I took the chance
I gave it all
And it's made me who I am

I am done for
I have won
I've done my part right
I'm number one
No matter what they thrown at me, I won
I am home
I'm number one

A fairytale of golden days
A lifetime of gift
An old man's travel
A young boy's wish

I am done for
I have won
I did my part right
I'm number one
No matter what they thrown at me, I won
I am home
I'm number one

I am home
I'm number one
