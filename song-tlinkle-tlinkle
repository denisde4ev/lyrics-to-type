#Chorus/Intro
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Do you know I'm not a toy?
I don't wanna be a part
Of your broken heart
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Don't you know I'm not a toy?
Are you scared of what you are
Lonely in the bar?

#Verse 1
Now I take your dog
And I take your cat
I'm tryin' to make you realise
Your castle of snow
Is falling apart
You're laughing 'cause you are dead inside

#Pre-Chorus
Oh, nothing can break you
Not the rain in the sky
Or the teardrops I tried to hide
So cold then you turn blue
Got a lesson to learn tonight
So boy bye

#Chorus
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Do you know I'm not a toy?
I don't wanna be a part
Of your broken hеart
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Don't you know I'm not a toy?
Arе you scared of what you are
Lonely in the bar?

#Verse 2
I look to the left
I look to the right
You're all alone, there's no one around
They say you're a kid
Your mama was right
Are you happy now that you lost your crown?

#Pre-Chorus
Oh, nothing can break you
Not the rain in the sky
Or the teardrops I tried to hide
So cold then you turn blue
Got a lesson to learn tonight
So boy bye

#Chorus
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Do you know I'm not a toy?
I don't wanna be a part
Of your broken heart
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Don't you know I'm not a toy?
Are you scared of what you are
Lonely in the bar?

#Bridge
We don't need no closure
It becomes so clear
Healing's never over
Nightmares hurt my dreams
Hurt my dreams

#Chorus
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Do you know I'm not a toy?
I don't wanna be a part
Of your broken heart
Twinkle twinkle, little boy
Don't you know I'm not a toy?
Are you scared of what you are
Lonely in the bar?
