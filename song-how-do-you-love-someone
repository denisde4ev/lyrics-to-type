Mamma never told me how to love
Daddy never told me how to feel
Mamma never told me how to touch
Daddy never showed me how to heal
Mamma never set a good example
Daddy never held mamma's hand
Mamma found everything hard to handle
Daddy never stood up like a man

I've walked around, broken
Emotionally frozen
Getting it on
Getting it wrong

How do you love someone
Without getting hurt?
How do you love someone
Without crawling in the dirt?
So far in my life
Clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love? How do you love someone?
How do you love? How do you love someone?

I was always the chosen child
The biggest scandal I became
They told me I'd never survive
But survival's my middle name

I've walked around, hoping
Just barely coping
Getting it on
Getting it wrong

How do you love someone
Without getting hurt?
How do you love someone
Without crawling in the dirt?
So far in my life
Clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love? How do you love someone?
How do you love? How do you love someone?

It's hard to talk
To say what's deep inside
It's hard to tell the truth
When you've always lied

How do you love someone
Without getting hurt?
How do you love someone
Without crawling in the dirt?
So far in my life
Clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love? How do you love someone?

How do you love someone
And make it last?
How do you love someone (love someone)
Without tripping on the past?
So far in my life
Clouds have blocked the sun
How do you love? How do you love someone?
How do you love? How do you love someone, someone?
