Listen up hatchet man
Set controls for the heart of the land
Tell 'em all it is time
You're the next in the chain of command
Apparition...
Direct the course for collision
Suspicion...
For the Reich to come to fruition

In the Twentie
We'll be singing in a reign of pennies
In the Twenties
We'll be soaring in disguise of bevies
In the Twenties
We'll be smootching at the feet of da rulah
In the Twenties
We'll be grinding in a pile of moolah

Listen up you motherfuckers
Those Ivy League dopes they wanna mock us
Tell 'em all this is war
And not fighting a war is for suckers
-Kiss my
Assassinate...
Gather the tools to disintegrate
-Feed
Hate...
Reaping the seeds as a reprobate
I'm Number One
You're number two
You've got a lot of God's work to do

In the Twenties
We'll be singing in a reign of pennies
In the Twenties
We'll be soaring in disguise of bevies
In the Twenties
We'll be taking no shit from no chulas
In the Twenties
We'll be grabbing 'em all by the hoohaas

In the Twenties
We'll be dancing in the fields of freedom
In the Twenties
We'll be crushing them laws 'cause we don't need 'em
In the Twenties
In the Twenties
All the way to the Thirties!

In the Twenties
We'll be singing in a reign of pennies
In the Twenties
We'll be soaring in disguise of bevies
In the Twenties
We'll be smootching at the feet of da rulah
In the Twenties
We'll be grinding in a pile of moolah
