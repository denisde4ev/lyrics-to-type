I know I messed it up with every other guy
I swear you're different, and this time I'm gonna try
We can start fresh if you'd just let go of the past, yeah
I don't, I don't, I don't get it 'cause I don't judge you like that

Can't just love me in pieces, gotta love it all
You try to make me feel like being human's wrong
You got a lot to say about me and my past
Well, I don't, I don't, I don't get it 'cause I don't judge you like that

Got me runnin' other places in my mind, in my mind
How could you even say I never try, never try?
And you're acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind in my mind, yeah

Da (x10)  yeah
Da (x10) 

You're acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind in my mind, yeah

I know that I could be with any other man
But none of them can do it quite the way you can
Thought we were stronger. Why you doubting all the time?
Well, I don't, I don't, I don't get it 'cause I'm so sweet all the time

Our love is effortless. Stop acting like you're scared
I get down on my knees, but you're not playing fair
My heart breaks down when you question if you're mine
When I don't, I don't, I don't get it 'cause I'm so sweet all the time

Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind
How could you even say I never tried, never tried?
And you acting like I been around with every single guy
Got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

Da (x10)  yeah
Da (x10) 

And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

Got me running to places where nobody else has gone
And I tried to take you with me baby then it went all wrong
And I said, "I'm here to stay but I need to get away."
So, I'm running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah

Da (x10)  yeah
Da (x10) 

And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah...

Da da da da da da da da da da yeah
Da da da da da da da da da da

And you acting like I been around with every single guy
You got me running other places in my mind, in my mind, yeah
