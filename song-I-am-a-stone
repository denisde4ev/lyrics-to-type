It's hard to say
That I'm back
On a straight line

You see my path
Is in fact
Just a fault line

It's in my blood, it's in my lungs
And it won't die

I fight these words, I bite my tongue
So I don't lie

Though it's me to blame
There is no more shame in me
In me...

I just feel the same
Immune to all this pain
And the scars don't write a song for me at all...

I am a stone, unaffected
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
Your fool I will not be

I am a stone, unaffected
-I am a stone
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
-I am a stone
Your fool I will not be

I try to see and believe
In the short sight
Accept the burn of a vain
And a half-life

And how you rest your faith in these for a lifetime
That hollow lie against my hope that I won't buy

Though it's me to blame
There is no more shame in me
In me...

I just feel the same
Immune to all you say
And the scars don't write a song for me at all...
No your tears won't line a path for me to crawl

I am a stone, unaffected
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
Your fool I will not be

I am a stone, unaffected
-I am a stone
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
-I am a stone
Your fool I will not be

The waters rise above my eyes
I will breathe it in and go out with the tide
And when you think this is the end
You will find me there where I have always been

I am a stone, unaffected
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
Your fool I will not be

I am a stone, unaffected
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
Your fool I will not be

I am a stone, unaffected
-I am a stone
Rain hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
-I am a stone
Your fool I will not be

I am a stone...
I am a stone
