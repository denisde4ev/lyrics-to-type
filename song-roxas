Why they flexing? Put them ones up
Tell 'em to take the hunnids out but they might get bum rushed
Haven't fed in a month, got bloodlust
I'm a vampire, won't see me when the sun's up

Why they, why they flexing? Put them ones up
Tell 'em to take the hunnids out, but they might get bum rushed
Haven't fed in a month, got bloodlust
I'm a vampire, won't see me when the sun's up

I'm a nobody, call me Roxas
Before me and Hercules, get to stomping
Yeah, I act immature and obnoxious
I be Dora exploring all my options
I be rocking with Brock and Onyx
Steel type magnemite and foretress
Told the Doc that it might be chronic
I might stink but I might just vomit

Holy quartet of breasts in the goth bitch chorus
Asking if I'm big, can't she tell that I'm enormous?
Mama said to eat your soup
I said, "Fuck it, eating porridge"
I'm with the three bears in the Goldilocks forest

Why they flexing? Put them ones up
Tell 'em to take the hunnids out but they might get bum rushed
Haven't fed in a month, got bloodlust
I'm a vampire, won't see me when the sun's up

Why they, why they flexing? Put them ones up
Tell 'em to take the hunnids out but they might get bum rushed
Haven't fed in a month, got bloodlust
I'm a vampire, won't see me when the sun's up

Might look like Jeremy White, but you know I'm not Shameless
And you know that the steel comes stainless
I'm a gem, can't you tell that I'm jaded?
Sapphire and ruby in the making
I don't hang with pigs, I'm allergic to swine
Tell 'em talk to these hands, I'm a certified mime
Dick don't hit the same, she still getting over mine
Call 'em all invertebrates 'cause they ain't got no spine

Why they flexing? Put them ones up
Tell 'em take the hunnids out, but they might get bum rushed
Haven't fed in a month, got bloodlust
I'm a vampire, won't see me when the sun's up

Why they, why they flexing? Put them ones up
Tell 'em to take the hunnids out, but they might get bum rushed
Haven't fed in a month, got bloodlust
I'm a vampire, won't see me when the sun's up
