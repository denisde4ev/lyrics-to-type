I explore bizarre desires incognito
Feed my suicidal libido
Posthuman parasite doll, fetish vehicle
Dark pleasure outside the comfort zone

I am the whiplash, you are the thunder
A primal hunger, now is the time
My kinda lady, silver and crazy
No room for maybes, we're partners in crime

Hardcore
Hardcore
Hardcore
Our private liberation of a lethal caress
Unsheathe your claws, my lioness
I delve into the center between your thighs
Insatiable demon undisguised

I am the whiplash, you are the thunder
A primal hunger, now is the time
My kinda lady, silver and crazy
No room for maybes, we're partners in crime

A fallen angel, sweet and pernicious
You're my delicious unholy wine
My kinda lady, silver and crazy
No room for maybes, we're partners in crime

I am the whiplash, you are the thunder
A primal hunger, now is the time
My kinda lady, silver and crazy
No room for maybes, we're partners in crime

A fallen angel, sweet and pernicious
You're my delicious unholy wine
My kinda lady, silver and crazy
No room for maybes, we're partners in crime

Hardcore
