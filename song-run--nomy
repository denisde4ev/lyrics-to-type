Everybody runs around without a reason
And nobody ever notice what's good for you
Take a minute when you walk alone

There is nothing to control you now
Everybody runs around without a reason
Take a minute when you walk alone
Give it up for a reason
Everybody's only living for the dreaming

Run motherfucker run
You will never be a part of me
And I will never be a part of you
And baby this is what I'm gonna do
Run motherfucker run
The situation is getting out of hand
Why doesn't anybody understand
You better run for your life if you can
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Did you know notice I'm not even really here now
I try to listen but I don't know what's good for you
Every second you are wearing me out

And I think I'm gonna lose it now
Everybody's holding on without a reason
Did you notice that I am not alive
I gave it up for a reason
Everybody's only living for the dreaming

Run motherfucker run
You will never be a part of me
And I will never be a part of you
And baby this is what I'm gonna do
Run motherfucker run
The situation is getting out of hand
Why doesn't anybody understand
You better run for your life if you can
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
You will never be a part of me
And I will never be a part of you
And baby this is what I'm gonna do
Run motherfucker run
The situation is getting out of hand
Why doesn't anybody understand
You better run for your life if you can
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run
Run motherfucker run

Run motherfucker run
You will never be a part of me
And I will never be a part of you
And baby this is what I'm gonna do
Run motherfucker run
