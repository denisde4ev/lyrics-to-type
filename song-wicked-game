World was on fire
No one could save me but you
It's strange what desire
Will make foolish people do

I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you

No, I wanna fall in love
This world is only gonna break your heart
No, I wanna fall in love
This world is only gonna break your heart
With you

This world is only gonna break your heart

What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you

What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

No, I wanna fall in love
This world is only gonna break your heart
No, I wanna fall in love
This world is only gonna break your heart
With you

World was on fire
No one could save me but you
It's strange what desire
Will make foolish people do
No, and I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
I'll never dream that I lose somebody like you, no

No, I wanna fall in love
This world is only gonna break your heart
No, I wanna fall in love
This world is only gonna break your heart
With you

This world is only gonna break your heart
No, I
This world is only gonna break your heart
This world is only gonna break your heart

Nobody loves no one
