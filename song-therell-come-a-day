I'm wide awake and you look perfect next to me
This photograph, I look so deep sometimes I hear you breathe
I'm here alone, try'n to hang onto my soul
But the distance takes its toll, you know, you know

I'm out here doin' all I can
You make me everything I am
Give me strength to get through somehow
I keep praying that it wont be long now

There'll come a day
When I can hold you and say its forever
There'll come a day
When these broken lives fade back together
There'll come a day
When I won't feel like this
I'll find my way
There'll come a day

I've seen enough things I wish I could erase
I shut my eyes and take myself back to a safer place
Where I can live the life you left behind
But as long as you're still mine, all mine, all mine

I'm out here doin' all I can
You make me everything I am
Give me strength I won't let you down
I keep hoping that it won't be long now

There'll come a day
When I can hold you and say its forever
There'll come a day
When these broken lives fade back together
There'll come a day
When I won't feel like this
I'll find my way
There'll come a day

I've stood for all that I believe in
Time now to start that healing
Take back the stolen time
Take back my life
There'll come a day
When I can hold you and say its forever
There'll come a day
When these broken lives fade back together

There'll come a day
When I won't feel like this
I'll find my way
There'll come a day
There'll come a day
There'll come a day
I won't lose faith
I'm wide awake and you look perfect next to me
