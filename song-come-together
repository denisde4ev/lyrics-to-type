############################################################
I was born in the jungle, yeah
Where the storm gonna rumble, yeah
Still gotta stay humble, yeah
Never let my dream crumble, yeah
As a world we so divided
Left & Right it's so polarizing
No alignment what the shows devising
They profit more when emotions rising
Media control the mindset
They ain't got hold of mine yet
An0maly why ain't you signed kid?
'Cause I'm too real for that fine print, yeah
But what I'm sayin' is bigger than me
I wanna see all world religions at peace
I'm sick of that rapper and I'm sick of that beat
I'ma change the game for the kids in that street, yeah

When the roof starts cavin' in, we come together
When the walls come crashin' down, we come together
We are farthest apart when we forget we have hearts
Now it's time for us to remember
It's now or never, there's no one better when
We come together

As a world we so divided
Cold inside from the polarizin'
Everyone is a hypocrite
'Cause we point the finger but don't get it yet
Black, white, gay, straight, man, woman
All these labels off-puttin'
Yeah, pride is great and I don't ever hate
But this tribalism just separatin'
It's okay to be yourself
But hurts when all you do is follow
Your soul and character gets hollow
The truth the hardest pill to swallow
Why do you think you're filled with sorrow?
'Cause peace ain't sold in jewels and bottles
You can't go livin' like them models
Because they aren't even models

Hold up, this is the truth, I spit in the booth
I don't do this for me, yeah, I did it for you
I bring water to drought, I was sent for the youth
To plant all of these seeds so the mission come true
This is the truth, I spit in the booth
I know life can get hard but this message is true
Please don't give up
This life is worth livin', I promise

When the roof starts cavin' in, we come together
When the walls come crashin' down, we come together
We are farthest apart when we forget we have hearts
Now it's time for us to remember
It's now or never, there's no one better when
We come together

My hair long like Don King
Y'all divide the nation like Shaun King
I'm a rockstar like The Offspring
Consider wisdom I'm offering
MLK wanted content
Plus Malcolm X, they got shot dead
Y'all better not come for my head
'Cause I got God, He don't want threats
That's secret service, I speak in verses
Like Allah, HaShem and Jesus worship
Y'all peep the purpose like ye's are perfect
I'll bring the church, you can keep the sermon
One love, yes each is worthy
Raise a World Cup, like a FIFA derby
When karma come it go all at once
So you better beg on your knees for mercy

Stop the hate and stop the threats
In Obama-blue or that MAGA-red
I know we can find that common thread
And make world peace like Ron Artest
Stop the hate and stop the threats
In Obama-blue or that MAGA-red
I know we can find that common thread
And make world peace like Ron Artest, yes

When the roof starts cavin' in, we come together
When the walls come crashin' down, we come together
We are farthest apart when we forget we have hearts
Now it's time for us to remember
It's now or never, there's no one better when
We come together
