Just as you can never guarantee that the person you like will like you back, you 
can never guarantee that the person you hate will hate you. Nor is it always 
possible that they'll let you hate them. We aren't characters in a manga... 
There's no human who is all bad. There is no human who is all evil. No one has 
the same personality when viewed from all angles, and no one has the same 
personality at all times.
