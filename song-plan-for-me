Dear son or daughter
I know we never met
I never saw your first breath
Or take your first step
I was so young me and ye mom
We got along
But we just weren't ready
Regrets there's been many
Heavy on my shoulders
You'd be five this October
But it just gets colder
Every year I don't know ye
We picked out names
But we were so afraid
My heart still aches
I'd do whatever it takes

If I could go back in time and make a change I would
If I could bring ye back to life erase the pain I would
If I could pray ye back tonight with no delay I would
I'll meet you up in heaven back together for good

I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
It was not your plan for me
I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
I'm right where I'm supposed to be
I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
I never left Your hands
Never left Your plan
Was never unplanned... I never left Your hands

Mom and dad I understand
But I wish I had the chance
I'll never feel the touch of hands
Or ever walk across the sand

I know I wasn't planned
But if you saw the way I dance
I would have led a band
But I'll never know romance

If born I would a changed the world
If born I'd of been your baby girl
I born you would a seen me twirl
Brown eyes and long golden curls
And guess what I still love you
Let it go, I still love you

I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
It was not your plan for me
I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
I'm right where I'm supposed to be
I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
I never left Your hands
Never left Your plan
Was never unplanned... I never left Your hands

Mom & dad
I know it hurts right now
But don't let the past shape your future
You've got your whole life ahead of you
God's already forgiven you
If you can just find the strength now
And forgive yourself
I love ye and I'll see you up here soon

I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
It was not your plan for me
I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
I'm right where I'm supposed to be
I was never unplanned, unplanned, unplanned
I never left Your hands
Never left Your plan
Was never unplanned
I never left Your hands

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
So please don't take my sunshine away
