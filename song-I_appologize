One day the shadows will surround me
Someday the days will come to end
Sometime I'll have to face the real me
Somehow I'll have to learn to bend
And now I see clearly

All these times I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize...

One day I'll face the Hell inside me
Someday I'll accept what I have done
Sometime I'll leave the past behind me
For now I accept who I've become
And now I see clearly

All these times I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize...

One day the shadows will surround me

All these times I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize
I apologize, I apologize
I apologize, I apologize
I apologize...
