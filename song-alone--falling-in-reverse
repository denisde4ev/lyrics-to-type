Oh! This is the end of everything that I've known
Oh! This is the end of everything that I've known

So come on!

Yo! White boy on the beat rockin' Gucci sneaks
All I do is win
Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me

Came from the lowest of lows
Rose to the top with a vision
My haters talkin' shit
While washin' dishes for a living

Fuck you bitches, I'm a business
I'll be kissing on your missus
What you spend in 15 months
Is what I spend in 15 minutes

Don't give a fuck about you
You feelin' froggy, motherfucker
Ain't a damn thing you can do
You're a bitch, you're a punk
Don't make me pull the plug
Cock it back and leave you slumped
Now that's what I call bad luck

Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh, and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I've got a lot of people talkin' nothin' but chatter
"Why'd you switch your style up?" and that I don't matter
Man, I've been in rap since I was shittin' in Pampers
Climbed the ladder to the top and now I'm shittin' on rappers

All I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossing the line
I find it kind of funny the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face to face you ain't got nothin' to say to me!

Alone!

So fuck you too!
You better take a step back before I call up the crew
You talk a lot of shit but you spread nothing but lies
You keep on running your mouth
You better open your eyes

Oh! This is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh! And if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone!

I'm on that wreck!
Fly like a jet!
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a 'vette
I'm on that next!
Girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world
Break your neck
Break your neck!
Yo

So break your motherfucking neck

I'm on that wreck!
Fly like a jet!
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a 'vette
I'm on that next!
Girl loves sex
No doubt I'm top of the world
Break your neck

I'm on that next!
Girl loves sex
No doubt now I'm top of the world
Break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck

Oh! This is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh! And if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

Oh! This is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh! And if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

I'm on that wreck
Fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racing a 'vette
I'm on that next
Girl love sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world
Break your neck
I'm on that next
Girl love sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world
Break your neck
I'm on that next
Girl love sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world
Break your neck

Yo! 2013 motherfucker! Falling In Reverse!
