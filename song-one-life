"What if god told you
To write a masterpiece?
Would you tell 'I'm you couldn't read?"

There's only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
Do you really wanna live this way?
Only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
Tell me do you wanna live this way?

"Wise men say
Life is what happens
While you're busy making plans
Life's not a rehersal
Gotta live it while you can
And getting a second chance
Is my blame and circumstance
Is that what men in the mirror
Read it and chase for answears, hey!
I could have defended me and the best
My family's car crashed
My brother fall getting stucked
Perhaps then, turn up the van and loosing my day
Shaking that our glass reverse to stand back
But the wheels on the bus keep rolling
Rolling all goin' aint nobody really knowin'
It's just flowin' a moment that
Can't be gone and admit it
So you gotta give heart
Never be timid, ahhh"

There's only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
Do you really wanna live this way?
Only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
Tell me do you wanna live this way?

"Complaining bout misdemeanors
While millions of people starve
Rather spend money shoppin' or sending gadgets to mars
Wintertime keep our cars in heated garage
For the homeless in the winter heat is just a mirage
I ain't saying I can change the world
Rappin' these bars but I can give a voice
Support the people and get involved
Increase the love decrease hatred
And the scars that too many of us
Carry all buried up in our hearts
Brother we can do some or we can do none
Ignorance is similar to a loaded gun
So don't let it pop off or we're all done
We've only got one"

There's only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
Do you really wanna live this way?
Only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
Tell me do you wanna live this way?

"Your only got one life
And now we takes
Got ass for self"

Do you really wanna live this way?
(this way)
Only one life
It's right here, it's right now
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
(this way)
Do you really wanna live this way?
(this way)
Only one life
It's right here, (right here)
It's right now, (right now)
What is pain
Do you really wanna live this way?
(this way)
Tell me do you wanna live this waaay?
(Think about it.)
