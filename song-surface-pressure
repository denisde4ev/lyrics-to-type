############################################################
I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum
I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed
I break what's demanded, but

Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker
In a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like
"Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"

Under the surface
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless
If I can't be of service
A flaw or a crack
A straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back? It's

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop
Whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to

Pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go
Whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens
I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve
As it heard how big the iceberg is

Under the surface
I think about my purpose
Can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes
A light wind blows
You try to stop it tumblin'
But on and on it goes

But wait, if I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation
Or simple pleasure?
Instead we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going
'Cause all we know is

Pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop
Whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just

Pressure like a grip, grip, grip and it won't let go
Whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks, no mistakes
No pressure
