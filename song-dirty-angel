Dirty Angel
Dirty Angel
Bum ba-da ee-ahh-um bum, ba bum bum (dirty angel) [x4]

Come, come, inside tonight
Let me feed your appetite
Boy, you wanna come all alone
Bring, bringing me to life
Gettin' all your blood tonight
Gonna make you feel all exposed

And no, you can't leave now
When it's almost over
So close to touchin' hell
And no, I can't ignite
When you survive
You're gonna go
Oh oh, oh

Love me and decree

I'm alive
Alive
I'm alive
Alive
Bum ba-da ee-ahh-um bum, ba bum bum (dirty angel) [x4]

Fix, fixin' my insides
Livin' like I'm gonna die
Gonna take your body and soul
Dig, diggin' into you
Feeding off your every move
Making your heart feel like a stone

You know, it's almost time
For my resurrection
Getting close to the end
But I can't ignite
When you survive
You're gonna go
Oh oh, oh

Love me and decree

I'm alive
Alive
I'm alive (I'm alive)
Alive
Bum ba-da ee-ahh-um bum, ba bum bum (dirty angel) [x4]

Is this the world I love
Or is it pictures of
A dream that won't stop until I awake again
Is this the world I love
Or is it pictures of
A dream that won't stop until I awake again

Bum ba-da ee-ahh-um bum, ba bum bum (dirty angel) [x4]

I'm alive
Alive (dirty angel)
