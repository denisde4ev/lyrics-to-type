############################################################
When I look at the world
Through the eyes of a child
I wonder where will it end
I don't wanna be a part of this

I need a break to get away
To feel alive again
There's a room I always run to
Where I can be me

Let the music take you to an out of place
Where there's room for you to put your
Fears aside and be yourself
Let the music heal you

There are so many things
I wanna do
Save the world in a blink
Well I do what I can do

But sometimes I just need a break
To feel alive again
There's a room I always run to
Where I can be me

Let the music take you to an out of place
Where there's room for you to put your
Fears aside and be yourself
Let the music
Let the music take you to a higher ground
Where there's room for you to put your
Fears aside and breathe a while
Let the music heal..

Your body and soul
I believe
We all do what we can
To create harmony
But when we've all had enough
All those up's and down's
Take some time to yourself
Let the rhythm carry you through it all

Let the music take you to an out of place
Where there's room for you to put your
Fears aside and be yourself
Let the music heal
Let the music take you to a higher ground
Where there's room for you to put your
Fears aside and breathe a while
Let the music heal you
