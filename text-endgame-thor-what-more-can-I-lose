Thor: Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.
Rocket: You speak Groot?
Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.
Groot: I am Groot.
Thor: You'll know when we're close.
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.
It's the birth place of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.

Rocket: Okay, time to be the captain. [presses two buttons]
So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.
Thor: Well, he's been dead before,
but this time I think it really might be true.
Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?
Thor: Both dead.
Rocket: Still got a mom, though?
Thor: Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket: A best friend?
Thor: Stabbed through the heart.

Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
Thor: Absolutely.
Rage and aa.. vengeance, anger, loss, regret...
They're all tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.
Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...
he's the toughest there is.
Thor: Well, he's never fought me.
Rocket: Yeah, he has!
Thor: He's never fought me twice. 
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.
Rocket: Better be some hammer.

Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice as many enemies as that,
and every one would have rather killed me,
but none succeeded.
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.
Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and
he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.
Fate wills it so.
Rocket: And what if you're wrong?
Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?
