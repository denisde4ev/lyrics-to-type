All the stupid lies and the stupid games
Left a vacancy in this picture frame
A prisoner by my own hands
'Cause if I can't have me then no one can

I need to heal what I inflict
But I'll burn that bridge when I get to it
As I play roulette with a broken gun
I confess these sins with a sharp and spiteful tongue

So how do I apologize
And put the tears back in your eyes?
When every canvas that I paint
Is a masterpiece made of my mistakes

Outlined in guilt, my portrait stares
In a gallery where the walls lie bare
As I modernize my antique ways
True colors can't escape the brush of fate

So how do I apologize
And put the tears back in your eyes?
On every canvas that I paint
Is a masterpiece made of my mistakes

Illustrate all my pain
And set it all ablaze
Burn
And set it all ablaze

So how do I apologize
And put the tears back in your eyes?
When every canvas that I paint
Is a masterpiece of my mistakes

And in the light of my demise
I see my failures in your eyes
Every canvas that I paint
Is a masterpiece made of my mistakes
