Just don't call me a headcase on the run
I will take you to the next stop with a gun
Don't take that word in your mouth, you're spoiling the fun
I will break you when your hands up prepare to fall
Crush your fingers and your head against the wall

Am I making myself clear?
'Cause I am the fear
Beg and crawl

Out of the way I'm in a hurry
Hell is on hold, no time to worry
[x2]

I will get you I will kill you I'm in a rage
Bloody lungs terrified do you know your place?
Your life depending on me, now I'll set you free
Your only true friend is so far gone
There's no heaven, just a spell you're dying here alone

Am I making myself clear?
'Cause I am the fear
Beg and crawl

Out of the way I'm in a hurry
Hell is on hold, no time to worry
/repeat twice

Beg and crawl

Out of the way I'm in a hurry
Hell is on hold, no time to worry
/repeat twice

Just don't call me a headcase on the run
-No time to worry
I will take you to the next stop with a gun
-I am the fear
I will break you when your hands up prepare to fall
Am I making myself clear?
'Cause I am the fear
