2 + 2 is 4 minus 1 that's 3 quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, i smoke trees
See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack,
You man were ducking (you man ducked)

Hold tight, Asnee (my brotha), he's got the pumpy (big ting)
Hold tight, my man (my guy), he's got the frisbee
I chop chop chop on the phone,
Movin' that cornflakes 
Rice Krispies, hold tight my girl, Whitney (my G)
On the road doin' ten toes, like my toes (like my toes)

You man thought I froze, I see a peng girl, then I pose (chilin)
If she ain't on it, I ghost, hah,
Look at your nose (check your nose fam)
You donut, nose long like garden hose (kyah)
I tell her nyan's not hot, I tell her nyan's not hot
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"

I said, "Babes, nyan's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her nyan's not hot (never hot)
I tell her nyan's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, nyan's not hot" (never hot)
Hop out the four-door with the 44,

It was one, two, three and four (us man)
Chillin' in the corridor (yo), your dad is 44
And he's still callin' nyan for a draw, let him know
When I see him, I'm gonna spin his jaw (finished)
Take man's Twix by force (take it), send man shop by force (send him)
Your girl knows I've got the sauce (flexin)

No ketchup (none)
Just sauce (saucy)
Raw sauce
Ah, yo, boom, ah
The ting goes skr...ahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pur....-boom

Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom, you dun know
I tell her nyan's not hot (nyan's not)
I tell her nyan's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, nyan's not hot" (never hot)

I tell her nyan's not hot (never hot)
I tell her nyan's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, nyan's not hot"
Ngan can never be hot (never hot), perspiration ting (spray dat)
Lynx Effect (come on), you didn't hear me did you? (nah)

Use roll on (use that), or spray
But either way, A B C D (alphabet ting)
The ting goes skr...ahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pur....-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom

You dun know, Big Shaq
Nyan's not hot
I tell her nyan's not hot (never hot)

Yo, in the sauna, nyan's not hot (never hot)
Yeah, skidika-pap-pap
