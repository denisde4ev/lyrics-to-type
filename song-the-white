The human heart is as deep as the ocean
A still can suddenly erupt into motion
A place of beauty and joy turning into darkness
But when a light shines upon a grey surface
The view can change and unveil a new purpose
A stone can shine just like a diamond if you polish it right

Where there is light there is dark emotion
Cynical sides of a mind that's broken
Fading away when a heart is opened
See a place of beauty shining in your darkness
Black and grey are turning into shining light white

The human soul can seem like the darkest of nights
Cold and frightening, void of anything lifelike
There's a place of power brimming through the darkness
I saw the fire that warmed me until sunrise
I saw the colors of day through darkness disguise
A soul can shine just like the sun if you just look at it right

Where there is light there is dark emotion
Cynical sides of a mind that's broken
Fading away when a heart is opened
See a place of beauty shining in your darkness
Black and grey are turning into shining light white

Where there is light there is dark emotion
Cynical sides of a mind that's broken
Fading away when a heart is opened
See a place of beauty shining in your darkness
See a place of beauty shining in your darkness

Where there is light there is dark emotion
Cynical sides of a mind that's broken
Fading away when a heart is opened
See a place of beauty shining in your darkness
Black and grey are turning into shining white
