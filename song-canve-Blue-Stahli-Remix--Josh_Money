I take a little pill
For every little lie
Just one more arcade token
For every promise broken
For every morning glory
Cornflower, blue necktie
Castrate my lack of inhibition
Take me
Feed me
Make me high
Make me high

When I carve a new path
A better life for me
What I do essentially
Is stay one step ahead

When I carve a new path
A better life for me
What I do essentially
Is stay one step ahead of you

I take a little pill
For every little lie
Just one more arcade token
For every promise broken
For every morning glory
Cornflower, blue necktie
Castrate my lack of inhibition
Take me
Feed me
Make me high
Make me high

When I carve a new path
A better life for me
What I do essentially
Is stay one step ahead

When I carve a new path
A better life for me
What I do essentially
Is stay one step ahead of you
