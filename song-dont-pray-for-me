-Will all who wish to die please raise their hands

I'm not lost in the dark
I'm not blind to what I see
I know the river is wide and the water is deep
I feel the cold, my heart skips a beat
I don't need your absolution
So don't hold that sword over me
For my confessions I don't need a church
I don't need salt to know where it hurts

Don't pray for me, no...

-Will all who wish to die please raise their hands

I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me!

Oh I needed a revolution
I never had a war in mind
And now the river runs dry and the fall is deep
The truth is dark and makes us bleed

In hell is where I stand
It's where I find my inner strength
For my confessions I don't need a church
I don't need salt to know where it hurts

Don't pray for me, no...

I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me!

-I'm going to let you pray for me

I cannot breathe for you
You're trying over and over, denying what I feel
And every time you bow down your head to pray
Don't pray for me, don't pray for me!
