There stands an ash called Yggdrasil
A mighty tree, showered in white hail
From there come the dews that fall in the valleys
It stands ever green above Urd's well

From there come maidens, very wise
Three from the lake that lies beneath the pole

One is called Urd, she's the weaver of faith
Another Verdande who's forever present
Skuld is the third, the future lives within her

Together they carve into the tree
The lives and destinies of children, men and gods

To them, the all-knowing, we pay our dues this day
As we bring you our hymn, Yggdrasil
