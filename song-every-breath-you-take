Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step that you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every vow you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
