No one can see me and I've lost all feeling
And now I know I won't die alone.
I'll stop you from breathing
and all your deceiving
and this house is not my own!

No!
More forgiveness.
No!
And the reason is
I know I won't die alone.

I have returned!
Everyone dies,
and everyone lies,
they're waiting for the second coming again.

Everyone tries to
hold onto their lives,
when no one's alive,
bring me 1-1-5!

You stand for nothing and
overlooked something.
I'll bring you down,
all on my own.

I'm the end I can taste it,
I'll justify hatred,
I am the chosen one,
left hand of all that's
sacred!

No!
More forgiveness.
No!
I'll bring you death and pestilence.
I'll bring you down on my own.

I have returned!

and everything dies,
look to the skies.
To see the end of
all creation again.

See with your eyes,
my army of flies.
When no one's alive
bring me 1-1-5!

I've lost all form and unity.
Where has my life gone?
I'll bring you doom that you can see
and bring you down to see you bleed.

Everyone dies,
and everyone lies.
They're waiting for the
second coming again,

Everyone tries to
hold on to their life,
When no one's alive
bring me 1-1-5!

and everything dies,
look to the skies.
To see the end of
all creation again.

See with your eyes,
my army of flies.
When no one's alive
Bring me 1-1-5!

And nobody cries when
everyone dies and
no one's alive
Bring me 1-1-5!
