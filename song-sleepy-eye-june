You, you would never leave behind
And heaven stands alone
And you, you can never change your mind
And heaven stands alone

I, I would never leave behind
And heaven stands alone
And I, I can never change my mind
And heaven stands alone

Now, nowadays I feel so strong
And always stand alone
And now, returning causes are long since gone
And always need some love
Rain, wash me from the stench of you
To always stand alone
And wind, blow me from the dark and true
To sail away from you
And earth, shake your ground and let me fall
To always land alone

And fire, burn my hope on piles of love
'Cause heaven lives alone
