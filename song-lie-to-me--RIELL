Going out my mind with this paranoia
I try to justify, but I
I can't escape the truth even though I'm trying

You do your part and lie, lie to me

Tell me you need this
Dress me in gold
Raise me so high your sins become my pedestal
Wish I believed it
A shame that I don't
I've heard it before and change I know you won't do

Lie to me, cross your heart and die for me
Never laid an eye on another, la-la lies
Talk sugar sweet but when you stop
All I see is just a fraud full of nothing other than la-la-la lies

Your story misaligns, it's not holding water
I try to mind the rain, but my
You're making quite the mess bringing stormy weather
Just do your part and lie, lie to me

Tell me you need this
Dress me in gold
Raise me so high your sins become my pedestal
Wish I believed it
A shame that I don't
I've heard it before and change I know you won't do

Lie to me, cross your heart and die for me
Never laid an eye on another, la-la lies
Talk sugar sweet but when you stop
All I see is just a fraud full of nothing other than la-la-la lies

lie to me
Tell me you need this
lie to me
Dress me in gold
lie to me
Raise me so high, your sins become my pedestal

lie to me
I wish they weren't lies
lie to me
Breaking the surface, I
lie to me
Know that I shouldn't love the way you lie
lie to me

Tell me you need this
Dress me in gold
Raise me so high, your sins become my pedestal
Wish I believed it
A shame that I don't (a shame that I don't)
I've heard it before and change I know you won't do

Lie to me, cross your heart and die for me
Never laid an eye on another, la-la lies
Talk sugar sweet but when you stop
All I see is just a fraud full of nothing other than la-la-la lies

lie to me
-la-la lies
lie to me
la-la-la lies
lie to me
-la-la lies
lie to me
lie to me
