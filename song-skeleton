Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton

A silhouette is following
Just waiting to break me down
I had it good, that's what I get
I guess that it's my turn now
Cut the wires, tangled, twisted
To find me again
Fracture, break me into pieces
'Til all that I am

Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Fix my head, stitch my soul
Find out where it all went wrong
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Skeleton

A blinding pain behind my eyes
Is covering up the truth
Inside my brain's a parasite
That's telling me what to do
Feeding on my happiness
Like I never deserved it at all
-I never deserved it at all
Feeling like a pessimist
When I just wanna laugh through it all
-To laugh through it all

Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Fix my head, stitch my soul
Find out where it all went wrong
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Skeleton

I project pain with the frame that I maintain
Pulling on chains, wanna break what I can't change
All of that rage put away in my ribcage
Comes out in stages, how could I stage this?
Bending over 'til you break your back for this
Go 'head and crack my ribs, and take my oxygen
I'm damned if I do or I don't, I'm breaking my bones
Can't make it alone, no
Making such a mess -hey
It's getting permanently painted in my head -hey
And there's no going back, so love me like I'm dead -hey
Until there's nothing left -hey
And watch me decompose -hey
'Til I'm

Skin and bones, vulnerable
Crack my ribs and make me whole
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Fix my head, stitch my soul
Find out where it all went wrong
Come and breathe the air into my lungs
I just wanna be your skeleton
Skeleton
