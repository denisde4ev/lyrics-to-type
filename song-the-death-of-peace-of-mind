I made another mistake
Thought I could change, thought I could make it out
Promises break, need to hear you say
"You're gonna keep it now"

I miss the way you say my name
The way you bend, the way you break
Your makeup running down your face
The way you touch, the way you taste

When the curtains call the time will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize love's the death of peace of mind

You're in the walls that I made with crosses and frames hanging upside down
For granted, in vain, I took everything I ever cared about

I miss the way you say my name
The way you bend, the way you break
Your makeup running down your face
The way you fuck, the way you taste

When the curtains call the time will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize love's the death of peace of mind
When the curtains call the time will we both be satisfied?
It wasn't hard to realize love's the death of peace of mind
Love's the death of peace of mind

You come and go in waves leaving me in your wake
You come and go in waves swallowing everything

Are you satisfied?
Love's the death of peace of mind
Mind
Mind

When the curtains call the time will we both go home alive?
It wasn't hard to realize love's the death of peace of mind
When the curtains call the time will we both be satisfied?
It wasn't hard to realize love's the death of peace of mind
Love's the death of peace of mind

Love's the death of peace of mind
