Yes
Yeah

Suffering for the lord is not an easy thing
Be it a conjuring
So ordained and adored, so immaculate
Ooh, so worth the debt

I'm your rock, baby
I won't back down
I'm your rock, baby
Ask yourself, ooh
Are you righteous?
Yes
You wanna play with the sire?
Yes

You want a view from the spire?
Yes
You want a seat by the pyre?
And never ever suffer again
Yes
Yeah
Yeah

Sacrifice for the horde leads the way from shame
Be it a losers game
The disdained and abhorred lash of the senate wip
Ooh, it's a power trip

I'm your rock, baby
I won't back down
I'm your rock, baby
Ask yourself, ooh
Are you righteous?

You and the greatest deceiver
And never ever suffer again

You washeth the sin from my feet
Holy mother
You shine like the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky
Holy mother
You washeth the sin from my feet

Holy mother
You shine like the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky
Holy mother
The world has set me on your shoulders
Holy mother
You shine like the sun and the moon and the stars in the sky
