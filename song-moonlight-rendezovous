Half-dead in the wasteland of steel and cement
Like a failed experiment
Hunted by a sunless city that never sleeps
Neon reapers rake the streets
Dreaming of a past I may have never had
Everything was false and planned
Aching, just a wind-up toy designed to feel
But the tears are real

I'm a phantom of flesh and fantasy
A machine with a soul in agony
Is there anything left to save of me
Be my remedy
All I want is to feel your love break through
Every piece of my heart belongs to you
With a kiss we will paint a flawless view
Of a moonlight rendezvous

Find me naked in my virgin misery
Like an unplayed melody
Save me, come close and whisper my true name
And become all soothing rain
Touch me like no one's touched me before
In the deep of a cold heart's core
Love me even if it's going to make a crime
We've crossed the line

I'm a phantom of flesh and fantasy
A machine with a soul in agony
Is there anything left to save of me
Be my remedy
All I want is to feel your love break through
Every piece of my heart belongs to you
With a kiss we will paint a flawless view
Of a moonlight rendezvous

I'm a phantom of flesh and fantasy
A machine with a soul in agony
Is there anything left to save of me
Be my remedy
All I want is to feel your love break through
Every piece of my heart belongs to you
With a kiss we will paint a flawless view
Of a moonlight...

I'm a phantom of flesh and fantasy
A machine with a soul in agony
Is there anything left to save of me
Be my remedy
All I want is to feel your love break through
Every piece of my heart belongs to you
With a kiss we will paint a flawless view
Of a moonlight rendezvous
