Did you find a way?
Or an excuse?
No matter what.

You need to choose!
There's no such thing as chance
You hold it all within your hands!

This river will flow
And answers will show
Providing us with all that we need to know
This fire will burn the tables will turn
We'll be together in never ending for which we earn

Do you see a price?
Or just a scare?
It's all up to you cuz' the world won't care!
There's no such thing as fate
There's only that witch you create!

This river will flow
And answers will show
Providing us with all that we need to know
This fire will burn the tables will turn
We'll be together in never ending for which we earn

Another day for us to find pieces of truth we left behind
When we stood backs against a wall
Another day for us to see that each of us can still be free
And give a meaning to it all

This river will flow
And answers will show
Providing us with all that we need to know
This fire will burn the tables will turn
We'll be together in never ending for which we earn

This river will flow
And answers will show
Providing us with all that we need to know
This fire will burn the tables will turn
We'll be together in never ending for which we earn
