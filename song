The Classic Project 1 The Classic Project 1 Lyrics
/: One more night, one more night,
one more night, uhh, uhh, uhh... :/

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue
We let them come true
/: Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever :/

I can't sing a love song
like the way it's meant to be
well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
but baby, that's just me
And I will love you, baby
Always
I'll be there forever and a day
Always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
I'll the heavens burst
And the words don't rhyme
and I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
and I'll love you - always

Welcome to the hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here

Lady in red
Is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be,
But I hardly know
This beauty by my side
I'll never forget, the way you look tonight.

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds, and mars,
Any heart, not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts...
Uuuh, Uuuh! love hurts

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling,
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning, and eternal flame
Say my name,
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feeling, oh...

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you.

/: Bad boys, bad boys
Watcha gonna do, Watcha gonna do
When they come for you? :/ (x4)

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why can't this be love?
I tell myself,
"Hey! Only fools rush in"
Only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll d___ed if I'll get caught up on the line.
Hey!

Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel
Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night
Kyrie eleison, where I'm going will you follow
Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light

Some day when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Uh, uh...

Amadeus, Amadeus,
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,
Oh, oh, oh, Amadeus
Come on and rock me Amadeus.
Amadeus, Amadeus,
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,
Oh, oh, oh, Amadeus
Eh!

Heavenly bound cause heaven's got a number
When she's spinning me around, kissing is a colour
Her loving is a wild dog, she's got the look
She's got the look (she's got the look)
She's got the look (she's got the look)
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue?
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
And I go la la la la la

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord

Babe, I love you so,
I want you to know
That I'm going to miss your love
The minute you walk out that door
So, please don't go

And we can build this dream together,
Standing strong forever,
Nothing's gonna stop us now.
And if this world runs out of lovers,
We'll still have each other,
Nothing's gonna stop us,
Nothing's gonna stop us, now.,.
Ohhh...

/: Take my breath away... :/

You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an airplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love, but a second-hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

Shout, shout
Let it aloud
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Yearning, burning
For you to justify my love

If you make sure you're connected
The writing's on the wall
But if your mind's neglected
/: Stumble you might fall :/ (x3)

Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Precious kisses
Words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why

We can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from wall to wall
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's takin' the cha-a-a-ance
Safety dance
I wannna safety dance
Is it safe to dance?

The night seems to fade,
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone... woo ho
The stars shine so bright,
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in Kingston Town

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the Joyride
Making one sky ride
A feeling like you're spellbound
Sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby

You're unbelievable!
You burden me with your problems,
By telling me more bout mine.
I'm always so concerned,
With the way you say you are,
you're always at stop,
To think of us,
being one is more than I'd ever known.
But this time I realize,
I'm gonna shoot through, and leave you.
The things, you say,
Your purple prose just gives you away.
The things, you say,
You're unbelievable.

Whether you´re a brother or whether you´re a mother,
You´re stayin' alive, stayin´ alive.
Feel the city breakin´ and everybody' shakin´
And we´re stayin´ alive, stayin´ alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin´ alive, stayin´ alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin´ aliiiiiiiiiiive.

/: I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love) :/

Missiles flying over your head
If you wanna survive get out of bed.
You're in the army now, oh, uh, oh
You're in the army, now.
Shots ring out in the dead of night
The sergeant calls: "Stand up and fight!"
You're in the army now, oh, uh, oh
You're in the army, now.

"I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover."

Backstroke lover always hidin' neath the covers
Till I talked to your daddy, he says
He said "you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a m___in"
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this!
/: Walk this way; talk this way :/
She told me to
/: Walk this way; talk this way :/
Just give me a kiss... like this!

You take myself, you take myself-control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the stories told
You take myself, you take myself-control

Come on
Let's talk about s__, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
/: Let's talk about s__ :/ (x4)

/: I want to break free :/
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied I don't need you
I got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

--- *(¿?)* ---
She drives me crazy (Uh, uh)
Like no one else (uh, uh)
She drives me crazy
I can't help myself (Uh, uh)

/: I've got the power :/
Ooooooh yeah-eah

/: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oooh, oh, oh :/ (x4)

When they were dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down that boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die (till you die, oooh till you die)

Mmmhhh yeeeh
/: I'm walking on sunshine, woooah :/ (x4)
And does it feel good!!
Hey, all right now
And does it feel good!!
Hey, yeah!

/: Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box :/
/: Am I living in a box :/

You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your -kiss

All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
And all that I wanted was you
You made all.... (every one of my dreams come true)
/: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff :/

/: When you call my name, it's like a little prayer.
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there.
In the midnight hour, I can feel your power.
Just like a prayer, you know I'll take you there :/
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
come on, run and tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
come on sugar, let me now

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
-
Darling you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'til the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

Pressure! Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure! That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

/: I've been thinking about you :/ (x4)
Shi-pow-pow!

I took my baby
On a saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Together forever and never you pass
Together forever we two
And don't you know
I would move heaven and earth
To be together forever with you

/: I Ain't afraid of no ghost :/

Relax don't do it
When you wanna go to it
Relax don't do it
When you wanna come
Relax don't do it
/: When you wanna come :/

Live baby live
Now that the day is over
I gotta new sensation
In perfect moments
Well so impossible to refuse

I tried to discover
A little something to make me sweeter
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart
I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you give me no reason,
Why you make me work so hard
/: That you give me no :/ (x4)
Soul, I hear you calling
Oh baby please, give a little respect to me.

In my imagination
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine
In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

Help me out of the life I lead
/: Remember the promise you made :/

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

/: Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me? - Ooooohhh! :/

She wants to dance with me!
'Cause I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me!
'Cause I'll let her be what she wants to be

I got this fever
That I can't control, that I can't control
Music makes me move my body
Makes me move my soul, makes me move my soul
I just don't know, don't know
How I'm gonna deal with you
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr. Beat
I just don't know, don't know
Won't you help me, Dr. Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr. Beat
Won't you help me, Dr. Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr. Beat
Won't you help me, Dr. Beat?
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr. Beat
Won't you help me, Dr. Beat?

If you change your mind,
I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
(That's all I ask of you honey)
Take a chance on me
Oh, ooohh

Cross my broken heart, boy
Cross my broken heart for you
I'm going to stay this time
Cross my broken heart, boy
Swear I'll never part from you
I want you to be mine

Annie are you ok?
Will you tell us that you're ok?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you - a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

'Cos this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Tell it to my heart.
Tell me I'm the only one.
Is this really love or just a game?
Tell it to my heart.
I can feel my body rock every time you call my name.

--- (Deletreo de letras en inglés) ---
/: A-E-A-E-I-O-U-U, I sometimes cry :/ (x4)

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

I've got to be
Got to be certain
I've got to be
So sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more

Boys, boys, boys
I'm looking for a good time
Boys, boys, boys
Get ready for my love
Boys, boys, boys
I'm looking for the good time
Boys, boys, boys
I'm ready for your love

How do you do, do you do,
The things that you do
No one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say Bye, Bye, Bye?

/: Cuba! Quiero bailar la salsa :/

(Go West) Life is peaceful there
(Go West) In the open air
(Go West) Where the skies are blue
(Go West) This is what we're gonna do
(Go West, this is what we're gonna do, Go West)

But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

A trivial pursuit
Love is just a game to you
And you never want to let romance begin
Cause I´m gonna make some moves,
I´m gonna get the jump on you
I´m not gonna play unless you let me win
I´m just a trivial pursuit
Love is just a game to you
And I´m gonna win no matter what to do
Cause I´m gonna make some moves
I´m gonna get the jump on you
And I´m not gonna be a trivial pursuit

(Yeah, can you feel it, baby? I can too)
/: It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation :/

I'm too sexy for my shirt too sexy for my shirt
So sexy it hurts
And I'm too sexy for Milan too sexy for Milan
New York and Japan

Uuuh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Uuh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Uuh heaven is a place on earth

Voyage, voyage
Plus loin que la nuit et le jour

Dans l'espace inouï de l'amour
Voyage, voyage
Sur l'eau sacrée d'un fleuve indien

(Voyage)
Et jamais ne reviens

Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Ba de ya! Say do you remember
Ba de ya! Dancing in September
Ba de ya! Never was a cloudy day

Hold on tight

She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous

What can I do, when feeling insecure?
Will you be there when I ask you for
Would you follow me anywhere?

It's the only way to live
In cars
Here in my car

At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire

Oh no, oh oh oh oh

Good thing

Doo doobie doo
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
Mutual friends I see sometime
That's not what I want to hear
Woo who, who, who
I want to hear she wants me near

Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

I gotta cut
Loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off a my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon,
You come and go, you come and go.
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams.
Red, gold, and green; red, gold and green.

99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man fuer UFOs aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
Eine Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn es so war
Dabei war da am Horizont
Nur 99 Luftballons

Don't get me wrong
If I'm looking kind of dazzled
I see neon lights
Whenever you walk by

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
Ay whey oh, whey oh, whey ohhhh

Oh Yeah! It was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah
And the man in the back said everyone attack
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said boy I want to warn you
It'll turn into a ballroom blitz
/: Ballroom blitz :/ (x4)
