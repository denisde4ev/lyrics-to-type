############################################################
We made a choice and now your voice sounds much stronger than before
When you tell me that you're okay
Still you should know that letting go is harder than I thought but.

Don't you say sorry there is nothing to forgive
Don't you say sorry for the way you wanna live

What's wrong is right
I spent all night trying not to think of you
Or the meaning of it all
Now that you're gone I'm moving on
Feels like I'm standing still but...

Don't you say sorry there is nothing to forgive
Don't you say sorry for the way you wanna live
Don't you say sorry for the person you would be
And I won't be sorry 'cause we set each other free

Let me say despite that I am hurting
I could not be further from regret
Somewhere there must be a lesson in this
I'm just not sure that I have found it yet

Don't say sorry!

Don't you say sorry there is nothing to forgive
Don't you say sorry for the way you wanna live
Don't you say sorry for the person you would be
And I won't be sorry 'cause we set each other free
