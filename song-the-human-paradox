Welcome to my attraction
One step in the wrong direction
One choice, is all you have to make
One ride and the world is ours to take
You're treading a thin red line
When you're trying to read my mind
In here, the world ain't black or white
No rules apply, no wrongs or rights

Can you really tell me what is right or wrong
When they're two sides of the same coin
Viewed in different ways
The Human Paradox
Step right into pandemonium
Welcome to my delirium
My Human Paradox
The Human Paradox

Join in on a grand expedition
A trip through my contradiction
Complex, diverse i guarantee
Your chance to be all you can be
I'm letting my nature talk
It's the only way I will walk
Life roars when given room to breathe
Let's break the laws of you and me

Can you really tell me what is right or wrong
When they're two sides of the same coin
Two different shades of me
The Human Paradox
Step right into pandemonium
Welcome to my delirium
My Human Paradox
The Human Paradox

Can you really tell me what is right or wrong
When they're two sides of the same coin
Two different sides of me
The Human Paradox
Step right into pandemonium
Welcome to my delirium
My Human Paradox
The Human Paradox

Can you really tell me
What is right or wrong
Two sides of the same coin
Two different sides of me
Step right into pandemonium
Welcome to my delirium
My Human Paradox
The Human Paradox
My human paradox
The human paradox
