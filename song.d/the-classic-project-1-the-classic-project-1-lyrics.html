<span>It&#039;s so hard to get old without a cause</span>
<span>I don&#039;t want to perish like a fading horse</span>
<span>Youth is like diamonds in the sun</span>
<span>And diamonds are forever</span>
<span>So many adventures couldn&#039;t happen today</span>
<span>So many songs we forgot to play</span>
<span>So many dreams are swinging out of the blue</span>
<span>We let them come true</span>
</p><p><span>/: Forever young, I want to be forever young</span>
<span>Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever :/</span>
<span>---</span>
<span>I can&#039;t sing a love song</span>
<span>like the way it&#039;s meant to be</span>
<span>well, I guess I&#039;m not that good anymore</span>
<span>but baby, that&#039;s just me</span>
</p><p><span>And I will love you, baby</span>
<span>Always</span>
<span>I&#039;ll be there forever and a day</span>
<span>Always</span>
<span>I&#039;ll be there till the stars don&#039;t shine</span>
<span>I&#039;ll the heavens burst</span>
<span>And the words don&#039;t rhyme</span>
<span>and I know when I die, you&#039;ll be on my mind</span>
<span>and I&#039;ll love you - always</span>

<span>But till then, darling, you&#039;ll never see me complain</span>
<span>I&#039;ll do my crying in the rain</span>
