Last night an angel came to say
"I'm sad your grandma passed away"
But now, my grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave in the grave

Rave in the grave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave in the grave

Granny wouldn't mind it when she passed away
And now I got it all explained
Cause now, my grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave in the grave

Rave in the grave, rave in the grave
Rave in the grave, rave in the grave

Rave in the grave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave in the grave

Don't you worry 'bout the dead life
You'll be in the hands of death
And death is pretty damn nice
So won't you take a breath?

We don't wanna be alive
No, we don't wanna be alive
No, we don't wanna be alive
No, we just wanna die

Rave in the grave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave
My grandma got a rave in the grave
Damn!
Rave in the grave
Rave in the grave
