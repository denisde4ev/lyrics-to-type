la-la-la-love x3
I like that sad boy

I go, I go, I go out my head
So lo-loco in my bed
In that t-shirt that you left
It goes -la-la-da in my heart
It goes tick-tock on the wall
Stuck here waiting for your call

Keep thinking you're bad, boy
Always making me mad, boy
When I know you're just a sad boy
But I like that, I like that
Keep acting like the bad boy
Keep making me mad, boy
Kinda cool to love a sad boy
Yeah, I like that, I like that sad boy

la-la-la-love x3
Yeah, I like that sad boy
la-la-la-love
That sad boy
I like that sad boy

Want, want, want you in a million pieces
It's nice to know your weakness, my lips can keep a secret, oh no
Take take take take take me in the shadows
Show me how good this could go, before you shoot your arrows, oh no

Keep thinking you're bad, boy
Always making me mad, boy
When I know you're just a sad boy
But I like that, I like that
Keep acting like the bad boy
Keep making me mad, boy
Kinda cool to love a sad boy
Yeah, I like that, I like that sad boy
