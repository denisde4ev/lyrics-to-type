This ain't Build-A-Bitch. A bitch
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build-A-Bitch. A bitch
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you. Yeah

Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lotta parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot

This ain't Build-A-Bitch. A bitch
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build-A-Bitch. A bitch
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you. One, two, three, ooh

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Boys are always playing dolls
Looking for their Barbie
They don't look like Ken at all
Hardly have a heartbeat
Need someone who falls apart
So he can play Prince Charming
If that's the kind of girl he wants
Then he forgot

This ain't Build-A-Bitch. A bitch
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build-A-Bitch. A bitch
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you. One, two, three

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
