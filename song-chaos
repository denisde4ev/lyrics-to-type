Chaos chaos chaos chaos
Chaos chaos chaos chaos

Bombs dropping on the runway the oceans overflown
I know for certain one day, I'll see you down below
I'll find some solace one day and you'll reap what you sow
I'll see you Bloody Sunday so you can burn for free
Close your eyes
Blinded by the fire in the sky
Misguided by the tribe
Sacrificed to the lord of the flies

No one can save you
No one can save you
The chaos awaits you

I can't see tomorrow
'Cause I might die today
I sing this sorrow
With a smile on my face
(Oh oh oh oh) (Oh oh oh oh)
I can't see tomorrow
Are we dead or alive
When the blind lead the blind in the
Chaos chaos chaos chaos
Chaos chaos
(The blind lead the blind in the)
Chaos chaos chaos chaos
Chaos chaos chaos chaos

I'm dead inside from the grip of violence
Don't you dare close your eyelids
Break you down just to break the silence
Can you hear it? (If you're quiet)
Blood on the streets, but my heart beats cold
I got secrets no one knows
Death from above, death from below
I tried to run but it won't let go
Everything we've ever loved gets buried underneath
Another grave for pretty sights
But you won't fucking bury me
I am the Alpha, the Omega
Meet your maker
You're all just empty souls saying I'm your fucking savior

No one can save you
The chaos awaits you

I can't see tomorrow
'Cause I might die today
I sing this sorrow
With a smile on my face
(Oh oh oh oh) (Oh oh oh oh)
I can't see tomorrow
Are we dead or alive?
The blind lead the blind in the chaos
(Oh oh oh oh) (Oh oh oh oh)
The blind lead the blind in the chaos
(Oh oh oh oh) (Oh oh oh oh)

Chaos chaos chaos chaos
Chaos chaos
(The blind lead the blind in the)
Chaos chaos chaos chaos
Chaos chaos chaos chaos
