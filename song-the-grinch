Once upon a time  there was a green creature. Living in the deep dark hills of Whoville
Whom hated the holiday season
He wanted to put an end to Christmas for no apparent reason
The creature was from a be a be a old sock

Wanted nothing more but to put an end to the Holiday trill
with end gold goal to steal Christmas away form the people Whoville

Tee goals of holhan@@tanick creature fr@i@@ch
and is is for there could never be a merry Christmas from the Grinch
