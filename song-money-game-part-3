Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy
1 years old and his first words were "Mine, mine, gimme!"
2 years old he was walking, 3 years old walking quickly
4 years old he was running 'round the pavements of the city
5 years old and his daddy told him "Listen here, son
You gotta learn to be a man, a man he works for what he wants"
6 years old and he's reading, writing, top of the bunch
And when he's 7, his progression made him student number 1
8 years old and he's praised for unusual grades
9, his parents pay for private school to nurture the flame
10, 11, 12, 13, he ascends and ascends
His daddy tells him "Son, money is the means to all ends"
14, solving complex mathematic equations
15, IQ 150, still elevating

16, he develops complex software code
That detects weaknesses in cyber security protocols
17, and he sells vision keeping a share
Not yet an adult, but he's practically a millionaire
18, and his daddy tells him "Now you're a man
This world don't give a damn about you, so take all that you can"
19, he turns a profit stocks and shares invest in product
20, double-down deposits, 21, his income rockets
22, he learns that truth is just an obstacle to wealth
If you manipulate the data, then a lie will sell itself
23, a life of luxury crystal and cocaine
24, he makes the Forbes list, they're applauding his name
25, and his daddy tells him, "listen here son
While you are sitting in your palace, that don't mean that you won"

26, a business shift he switches business to arms
27, dealing nuclear and shells in Iran
28, inside the Senate money bought him a seat
29, a role of the council in the president, sweet
Now he's 30 and his daddy says "You're losing the race
You're just a servant to the king, not even in second place"
31, a big maneuver for his daddy's approval
Moving imports over borders from the exports out of Cuba
32, moving grams, growing kilos to tonnes
He's 33, filling warehouses with powder and guns
34, turf war with nobody to stop it
Blind eye from the po-po inside of his pocket
35 and he gets a call, "I'm sorry son
It's your father, had a heart attack, I'm sorry, he's gone"

36, getting pissed up, abusing his product
37, eyes glazed, disposition demonic
38 with a prostitute, a moment of passion
Heating up a silver spoon and then chasing the dragon
39, getting reckless and hungry for power
Daddy's words still driving him to kill and devour
He makes a move against the cartel, but the strategie's flawed
They retaliate and leave him in a hospital ward
A bullet buried in the vertebra and one in the leg
The doctor sighs and says "I don't think you'll be walking again", fuck

Let me tell you a story about a boy named Jimmy
He was 40, and he cursed the words "Mine, mine, gimme"
41, he wasn't walking, 42, not walking quickly
43, never running 'round the pavement of his city
44 inside his palace with a mountain of gold
But the riches turn to rubble when perspective evolves
Weighing heavy on his conscience is the value of gold
A Lamborghini for a life, trading money for souls
Jimmy followed the code inside the land of the free
Put your hand inside the cookie jar, take more than you need
And his is example is exaggerated versions of me
And it's a version of him, and it's a version of she
And it's a version of you, there's no escaping the blame
The way we live is parasitic, fuck the money and fame, cut the music!

This ain't entertainment, this is real life
The way we live is lunacy, community, it declines
Hyperpolerised, always fighting, then we divide
Truth is less important than the money that we designed?
Money's an invention, politics from our invention
They all come from peoples ideas, did I mention?
Borders? Our invention, law and order, fuel the tension
That leads to people killing each other. My solution?
Everything is subject to change
We can build utopias if individuals are taught to use their brains
But if we teach kids in school to always be sheep
And put ourselves before the herd if there's more money for me
Then there's no future I see, where the humans survive
We're parasites inside a Petri dish with cannibal minds
Mold grows upon a surface, it consumes till it dies
And our fate could be the same, so here's a story for the wise

45, Jimmy comes home out of the rain
Soaking wet upon a wheelchair, drinking again
He is everything he wants, he has fortune and fame
He's a fortunate fool with an unfortunate fate
With a 45 caliber aimed at his brain
45 - a fitting number, 'cause his age is the same
Hears the words of his father; "Such a damn shame"
Then he presses on the trigger of a money game
