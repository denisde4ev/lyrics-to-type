It's easier to lie
If I'm being honest
But you won't tell me why
You're shaking like you're nervous
I found out where you hide
When nobody is looking
This is my goodbye
Was it all worth it?

I could scream, you could shout
We could burn this whole place down
I just want to know how
Could you find better?
Tell me what I did wrong
Was it so hard to admit?
You couldn't stand to see me gone
Was it all worth it?

You looked me in the eye
And promised me you meant it
Aren't you getting tired
Of constantly pretending?
It's sad that I believed
That this ever meant something
This is my goodbye
Was it all worth it?
