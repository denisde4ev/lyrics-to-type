No more tears, I cannot cry no more
No fears, I just don't care for this life
Dark and grey, that's how it seems to me
And more â€“ what can it mean to me
Oh why, tell me why
I'm passing by
And my life, yeah, my life goes on, goes on without, without you and me

I don't live here
I'm just like a stranger
And my mind is
So full of hate and anger
I can tell you
My life is just an empty hollow

I can't stay here
I am slowly dying
And found nothing
That makes sense to try it
I can tell you
My life is just an empty hollow

Time to go, there's nothing holding me
I know that all what is can't go
Away from here, it's just a constant flow
It's change, so I can find my peace of mind

it's alright
And all this time
I've been starving, starving to be all so free inside, for you and me

I don't live here
I'm just like a stranger
And my mind is
So full of hate and anger
I can tell you
My life is just an empty hollow

I can't stay here
I am slowly dying
And found nothing
That makes sense to try it
I can tell you
My life is just an empty hollow
Empty hollow
