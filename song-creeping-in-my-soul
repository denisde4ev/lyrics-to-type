I see your face before my eyes
I'm falling into darkness
Why must I fight to stay alive?
Heroes fallen

Wake me, can't you hear me calling?
Out of darkness, they come crawling

Here I am, I am lost in your land
And I hope you will be creeping in my soul
Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call
And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul

Creeps from the deep's gonna be freaking up your mind
Creeps from the deep's gonna be feeding off your spine

I fade away into the night
My eyes are closing in
Shadows are fleeing from the light
My nightmares can begin

Wake me, can't you hear me calling?
Out of darkness, they come crawling

Here I am, I am lost in your land
And I hope you will be creeping in my soul
Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call
And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul

Creeping in my soul, it's getting out of control
I got to find my escape and get out of this black hole
'Cause justice in the world is hard to find
Time has come, got to make up my mind
No matter how deep or remote I hide
All my thoughts seem caught up inside
Creeps from the deep's gonna be freaking up your mind
Creeps from the deep's gonna be feeding off your spine

Here I am, I am lost in your land
And I hope you will be creeping in my soul
Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call
And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul

Here I am, I am lost in your land (Here, I am)
And I hope you will be creeping in my soul (I'm lost)
Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call (I'm lost)
And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul
