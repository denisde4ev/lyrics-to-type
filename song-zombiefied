Zombified

The monsters aren't living under your bed
'Cause they are the voices in your head
Zombified by the lies they've said
We've become the walking dead

'Cause everybody's talking bitch
Oh no, they'll never let go
Of something you said 10 years ago
They're cancelling, cancelling you
And they won't stop 'till everybody's

Zombified
They're pumping us with lies
Like it's formaldehyde
They're dead inside
It goes on and on, let this go
When it stops, we'll never know
We're hypnotized
And they won't stop 'till you're
Zombified

You better shut your mouth and bite your tongue
'Cause you don't wanna piss off anyone
We're traumatized by the damage done
Welcome to America

'Cause everybody's talking bitch
Oh no, they'll never let go
Of something you said 10 years ago
They're cancelling, cancelling you
And they won't stop 'till everybody's

Zombified
They're pumping us with lies
Like it's formaldehyde
They're dead inside
It goes on and on, let this go
When it stops, we'll never know
We're hypnotized
And they won't stop 'till you're
Zombified

Go! (Hahahaha)
They're feeding off your broken mind
They won't die, they multiply
We've become so fucking blind
They won't stop 'till you're zombified!
Pick it up!
Oh, oh

Now everybody's zombified
They're pumping us with lies
Like it's formaldehyde
They're dead inside
It goes on and on, let this go
When it stops, we'll never know
We're hypnotized

And they won't stop 'till you're
They won't stop 'till I'm
They won't stop 'till we're all
Zombified
