I' tired of everything
I'm tired of looking at myself
The dark descending in my eyes
It's hard to compromise
It's hard to walk a straight line
Unaffected by my scars

So just breathe into me
Breathe into me
Now I stand alone

Give me your worst
Give me all of your estimated lies
'Cause I will be the last one here alive
I walk this path alone
Deliver me pain
Give me faith as my wounds they slowly die
And I will be the last one here alive

I suffer to find the truth
I'm surviving the trails that's brought to me
Undecided stands my fate
I walk this path alone
I walk with an endless shadow
And I'm no hero behind these scars

So just breathe into me
Breathe into me
Now I stand alone

Give me your worst
Give me all of your estimated lies
'Cause I will be the last one here alive
I walk this path alone
Deliver me pain
Give me faith as my wounds they slowly die
And I will be the last one here alive

I've burned my bridges for the last time
No one wants to die alone
On this throne we call our home
And hope will seek to find me
I will settle down with peace
If you breathe into me
Breathe into me

Now I stand alone

Give me your worst
Give me all of your estimated lies
'Cause I will be the last one here alive
I walk this path alone
Deliver me pain
Give me faith as my wounds they slowly die
And I will be the last one here alive
