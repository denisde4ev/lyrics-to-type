Beware the night
Beware the night before the dawn
Beware the dark when light is gone
For there's a phantom lust to wake

They wanna make you bend and scream
They want to take your hand and lead
You in the light of Venus

Girl, come let them take you for a ride
Forget the Lord and cross tonight
And let your carnal lust prevail tonight

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons come at night and they bring the end
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons come alive and they take command
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend

Beware the fire
Beware the fire in their eyes
Beware of hormone-driven lies
For there's a truth behind the veil

They make you part of blackened rites
Protect the Grail between your thighs
Your antidote of evil

Girl, come resurrect him to the sky
And wave all innocence goodbye
And let desire take command tonight

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons come at night and they bring the end
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons come alive and they take command
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend

And when your sleep is haunted in the night
Girl don't you dare to seek for candle light
'Cause in the dark, your demons come as carnal dynamite

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons of the night, come and take her hand (come and take her hand)
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons 'tween her thighs come and make them stand (come and make them stand)
Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Demons are a girl's best friend
