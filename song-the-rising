The raven's flown away
The wolf begins to shiver
Who will pay the price?
The Hunter will remember
Rise, fall, stand again

I'm awake, I'm alive
Standing my ground until it's time

And the rising awakes
I am sorry, but I will break you
And the rising awakes
The sky is falling
Taste our revolution

We're trembling in the night
But hard is our emotions
Iron to the sky
Reclaiming our souls

I will climb, and I will strike
One for every burning scar

And the rising awakes
I am sorry, but I will break you
And the rising awakes
The sky is falling
Taste our revolution

And the rising awakes
I am sorry, but I will break you

And the rising awakes
The sky is falling
Taste our revolution

And the rising awakes
I am sorry, but I will break you

And the rising awakes
The sky is falling
Taste our revolution
