############################################################
You got me trapped inside this spell
Now I feel it
Now I feel it

Your demons trapped me closed too well
I can feel them
I can feel them pull me down

You never let me leave you
You make these nightmares come true
My heart is in the cloud
You fucked me up, I'm sober now, I'm
You never let me leave you
You make these nightmares come true
My heart is in the cloud
You fucked me up, I'm sober now, I'm

Feel it
Nightmares come true
I feel it
I'm feeling closer
Feel it
Nightmares come true
Feel it
I'm feeling closer

Feel it

I'm feeling closer

Feel it
Pull me down

You never let me leave you
You make these nightmares come true
My heart is in the cloud
You fucked me up, I'm sober now, I'm
You never let me leave you
You make these nightmares come true
My heart is in the cloud
You fucked me up, I'm sober now, I'm
Feel it
Nightmares come true
Feel it
