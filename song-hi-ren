Ooh...

Hi there Ren
It's been a little while, did you miss me?
You thought you'd buried me, didn't you?
Risky, 'cause I always come back
Deep down you know that
Deep down you know I'm always in periphery
Ren aren't you pleased to see me?
It's been weeks since we spoke bro, you know you need me
You're the sheep, I'm the shepherd, not your place to lead me
Not your place to be biting off the hand that feeds me

Hi Ren
I've been taking some time to be distant
I've been taking some time to be still
I've been taking some time to be by myself
Since my therapist told me I'm ill
I've been making some progress lately
And I've learnt some new coping skills
So I haven't really needed you much man
I think we need to just step back and chill

Ren, you sound more insane than I do
You think that those doctors are really there to guide you?
Been through this a million times
Your civilian mind is so perfect at always being lied to
Okay, take another pill boy
Drown yourself in the sound of white noise
Follow this ten step program, rejoice!
All your problems will be gone, fucking dumb boy!

Nah mate, this time it's different man trust me
I feel like things might be falling in place
And my music's been kinda doing bits too
Like I actually might do something great
And when I'm gone maybe I'll be remembered
For doing something special with myself
That's why I don't think that we should talk man
'Cause when your with me it never seems to help

You think that you can amputate me?
I am you, you are me, you are I, I am we
We are one, split in two that makes one so you see
You got to kill you if you wanna kill me
I'm not left over dinner, I'm not scraps on the side
Oh your music is thriving? Delusional guy
Where's your top ten hit? Where's your interview with Oprah?
Where are your Grammys Ren?
Nowhere!

Yeah but, my music's not commercial like that
I never chased numbers, statistics or stats
I never write hooks for the radio, they never even play me
So why would I concern myself with that?
But my music is really connecting
And the people who find it respect it
And for me that's enough 'cause this life's been tough
So it gives me a purpose I can rest in

Man, you sound so pretentious
Ren, your music is so self centered
No one wants to hear another song about how much you hate yourself, trust me
You should be so lucky having me inside you to guide you
Remind you to manage expectations
Provide you perspective, that thing you neglected, I get it
You wanna be a big deal, next Jimi Hendrix? Forget it

Man it's not like that
Man it's just like that I'm inside you you twat
Nah it's not man your wrong, when I write I belong
Let me break the fourth wall by acknowledging this song

Ren sits down
Has a stroke of genius
He wants to write a song that was not done previous
A battle with his subconscious, Eminem did it
Played on guitar
Plan B did it

Man, your not original you criminal, rip off artist
The pinnacle of your success is stealing other people's material
Ren mate, we've heard it all before
Ohh, "She sell sea shells on the sea shore"

Fuck you
I don't need you, I don't need to hear this
'Cause I'm fine by myself, I'm a genius
And I will be great, and I will make waves
And I'll shake up the whole world beneath us

That's right speak your truth
Your fucking god complex leaks out of you
It's refreshing to actually hear you say it, instead of down play it
"Oh, music Is all about the creative process
And if people can find something to relate to within that then that's just a bonus"

Fuck you, I'ma fucking kill you, Ren
Well, fucking kill me then, let's fucking have you Ren
I'm a do it, watch me prove it, who are you to doubt my music?
'Cause I call the shots I choose if you die
Yeah, I call the shots and so I who choose who survives
I'll tie you up in knots then I'll lock you inside

News flash
I was created at the dawn of creation
I am temptation
I am the snake in Eden
I am the reason for treason
Beheading all Kings, I am sin with no rhyme or reason
Sun of the morning, Lucifer, Antichrist, Father of lies
Mestophilies, truth in a blender, deceitful pretender
The banished avenger, the righteous surrender
When standing in-front of my solar eclipse
My name it is stitched to your lips so see
I won't bow to the will of a mortal, feeble and normal
You wanna kill me? I'm eternal, immortal
I live in every decision that catalyzed chaos
That causes division
I live inside death, the beginning of ends
I am you, you are me, I am you Ren

Hi Ren
I've been taking some time to be distant
I've been taking some time to be still
I've been taking some time to be by myself
And I've spent half my life ill
But just as sure as the tide start turning
Just as sure as the night has dawn
Just as sure as rain fall soon runs dry
When you stand in the eye of the storm
I was made to be tested and twisted
I was made to be broken and beat
I was made by His hand, it's all part of His plan that I stand on my own two feet
And you know me my will is eternal
And you know me you've met Me before
Face to face with a beast, I will rise from the east
And I'll settle on the ocean floor
And I go by many names also
Some people know me as hope
Some people know me as the voice that you hear
When u loosen the noose on the rope
And you know how I know that I'll prosper?
Because I stand here beside you today
I have stood in the flames that cremated my brain
And I didn't once flinch or shake

So cower at the man I've become
When I sing from the top of my lungs
That I won't retire I'll stand in your fire
Inspire the weak to be strong
And when I am gone I will rise
In the music that I left behind
Ferocious persistent, immortal like you
We're a coin with two different sides

Ooh... ooh...

When I was seventeen years old
I shouted out into an empty room
Into a blank canvas, that I would defeat the forces of evil
And for the next ten years of my life I suffered the consequences
With autoimmunity, illness and psychosis
As I got older I realized that there were no real winners
Or no real losers in psychological warfare
But there were victims and there were students
It wasn't David versus Goliath, it's was a pendulum
Eternally swaying from the dark to the light
And the more intensely that the light shone, the darker the shadow it casts
It was never really a battle for me to win
It was an eternal dance
And like a dance, the more rigid I became, the harder it got
The more I cursed my clumsy footsteps, the more I struggled
So I got older and I learned to relax
And I learned to soften, and that dance got easier

It is this eternal dance that separates human beings, from angels, from demons, from gods
And I must not forget, we must not forget
That we are human beings
