Christine
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

The phantom
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

Christine
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

The phantom
It's me they hear

Christine
Your spirit and my voice in one combined

The phantom
My spirit and your voice in one combined

Both
The phantom of the opera is there

Christine
Inside my mind

The phantom
Inside your mind

Choir (very, very soft)
He's there,
The phantom of the opera
Beware,
The phantom of the opera

The phantom
In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery

Christine
Were both in you

Both
And in this labyrinth
Were night is blind
The phantom of the opera is

Christine
Here

The phantom
There

Christine
Inside my mind

The phantom
Sing! My angel of music

Christine
He's there
The phantom of the opera

Christine starts wailing
The phantom

Sing...

Christine continues wailing,
and keeps on wailing after every
sentence the Phantom sings
The phantom

Sing for me...
Sing, my angel of music!
Sing for me!
