This world that we know is not reality
It's all just a vision bringing me to my knees
Now in this infinity

Something's changing all I know
To the point where I can't
Tell if this path is the one that I chose
If there really is such a god
Who keeps looking down on me
Will they keep on pulling
My strings of fate and just watch as it goes

Then I'll be
Be the only one
Fighting against time
And fighting for miracles
I'll be the one to set them free
I can fly high!

If you have a memory
If you have just one place
If you have that something that you'll never replace
Don't ever let go of it
Don't let it walk away

Don't ever let go
Even if those memories bring you pain and sorrow
Just remember that they'll lead you to tomorrow
They'll be your star guiding you through this world, so new
There is no god
Wonderful new world

This life that I'm living is a fantasy
We move, never knowing of this waking dream
Still the answer to this plea
Is a paradox unsolved

But the answer's buried
Deep in the worlds that live on far beyond
Taking all parts that are me
Strip away the logic here
Maybe then I'll finally
Have some control and they won't disappear
It will be

Be what I can see
Nothing can change in this algorithm cause
It seems like this is destiny

I can fly high!
Showing that I love you
Saying that I love you
Memories are clearer when they start to cut through

I promise never again will I allow myself to ever forget
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
Was to be forever standing there at your side

Being with you as we go through this world so new
There is no god
Wonderful new world

This place is worth visiting twice
Being together, we'll reach the heavens and
Connect all the pieces that scatter beyond!
I can fly high!

If you have a memory
If you have just one place
If you have that something that you'll never replace

Don't ever let go of it
Don't let it walk away
Don't ever let go

Even if those memories bring you pain and sorrow
Just remember that they'll lead you to tomorrow
They'll be your star guiding you through this world, so new

There is no god
Wonderful new world
