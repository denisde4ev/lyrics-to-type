"Time" is so sad and fleeting
Can't be controlled, like a river, never stops
"Space" is emptiness dark and so cold
Can you define it's presence, does it exist?

We drift through the heavens,
Everlasting feeling
Filled with the love from up above
He guides my travels,
Running out of time
Shed a tear and leap to a new world

Cosmos and their creation
Tell me do they exist for infinity

Stars burn, burning so bright but they'll fade
How will I know?
Secrets kept until I die

Defy my destiny, Things I want to protect
Foolish, but it's humanity

Imagination, Change it into a miracle
Things you can't conceive
Revelation!

A drop in the darkness

a tiny life
Unique and precious forever

Bittersweet memories?
evanescent moment
Make this moment last, last forever

We drift through the heavens,
Everlasting feeling
Filled with the love from up above
He guides my travels,
Running out of time
Shed a tear and leap to a new world
