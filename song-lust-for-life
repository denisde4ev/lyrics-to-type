Strange this sensation in my mind
Creature I will become one
On my way, there's no sun
But I have to carry on

Look my force is more powerful
Piece by piece vampire rules
On my way, in my world
I realize past life has gone

Future's changing again
Impulses're driving me away in hell

No tears in my eyes
There's no beat in my heart
I just feel the pain
Growin' into my brain
I'm still the son
The abandoned child of eternity

I don't belong to the sky
I just follow my way
Ready to roam in the night
I hear this symphony
Running after the devil
The prince of immortals

Feared by everyone
I am strong as hard as metal
Innocent blood I must take on
The crime is in my soul
Lust for life

I don't belong to the sky
I just follow my way
Ready to roam in the night
I hear this symphony
Running after the devil
The prince of immortals

Freak for every one
I am proud as strong as metal
Creature of flesh I must devour
To be free
Lust for life

Every night the realm is mine
Beware until the sunrise in the sky
In the night I stay here to bite
Take care of you, blood thirsty I am one
Eternally
And in my dream
All victims forgive me
They watch me in the sky
They light my way from the other side

No tears in my eyes
There's no beat in my heart
I just feel the pain
Growin' into my brain
I'm still the son
The abandoned child of eternity

I don't belong to the sky
I just follow my way
Ready to roam in the night
I hear this symphony
Running after the devil
The prince of immortals

Feared by everyone
I am strong as hard as metal
Innocent blood I must take on
The crime is in my soul
Lust for life

I don't belong to the sky
I just follow my way
Ready to roam in the night
I hear this symphony
Running after the devil
The prince of immortals

Freak for every one
I am proud as strong as metal
Creature of flesh I must devour
To be free
Lust for life
