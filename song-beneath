I have returned from down under
I've learned to breathe beneath the waters
I've returned to the light

Beyond the waves of madness
Around my neck a stone tied
Enduring crushing darkness
Starless void of ageless night
Visions that none can utter
Bound to the demons of the sea
Till I became the hunter
Dark dreams ever so far beneath

Damned to descend and discover
What dies down beneath never slumbers
I've returned to the light

Beyond the waves of madness
Around my neck a stone tied
Enduring crushing darkness
Starless void of ageless night
Visions that none can utter
Bound to the demons of the sea
Till I became the hunter
Dark dreams ever so far beneath

So far beneath

Beyond the waves of madness
Around my neck a stone tied
Enduring crushing darkness
Starless void of ageless night
Visions that none can utter
Bound to the demons of the sea
Till I became the hunter
Dark dreams ever so far beneath

So far beneath
